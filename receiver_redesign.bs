# Introduction # {#intro}

This paper proposed a refactorization of the receiver concepts of [[P2300R4]] to address concerns raised during its design review.

## Motivation ## {#motivation}

In [[P2300R4]], the receiver concepts are currently expressed as follows:

```c++
    template <class T, class E = exception_ptr>
    concept receiver =
      move_constructible<remove_cvref_t<T>> &&
      constructible_from<remove_cvref_t<T>, T> &&
      requires(remove_cvref_t<T>&& t, E&& e) {
        { execution::set_stopped(std::move(t)) } noexcept;
        { execution::set_error(std::move(t), (E&&) e) } noexcept;
      };

    template<class T, class... An>
    concept receiver_of =
      receiver<T> &&
      requires(remove_cvref_t<T>&& t, An&&... an) {
        execution::set_value(std::move(t), (An&&) an...);
      };
```

During the design review of P2300, LEWG raised the following concerns about the
form of these concepts:

1. Since `set_value` is permitted to be potentially throwing, and since the
    receiver type is not known when a sender is asked to compute its completion
    signatures, most senders will need to pessimistically report that they can
    complete exceptionally, when that may in fact not be true. This may cause the
    instantiation of expensive error handling code that is effectively dead.

2. No receiver `R` can satisfy the `receiver<R>` or `receiver_of<R, As...>`
    concepts without providing an error channel for `exception_ptr`. This has the
    following problems:

    * `exception_ptr` is a relatively heavy-weight error type, not unlike a
        `shared_ptr`. Requiring the presence of this channel is likely to cause
        needless code generation.

    * It makes it questionable whether any of P2300 can be reasonably expected
        to work in freestanding environments, which often lack exception
        handling support.

Although the design of P2300 is sound, LEWG nevertheless wanted an investigation
into these issues and a recommendation to be made.

This paper makes a recommendation to change the receiver concepts to address
these concerns.

## Design Summary ## {#design-summary}

This paper proposes to make the following changes, summarized here without
commentary. Commentary is provided below.

* Remove the default implementation of the `get_env` receiver query.

* The `receiver_of` concept takes a receiver and an instance of the
    `completion_signatures<>` class template.

* A receiver's customization of `set_value` is required to be `noexcept`.

* The `sender_to<Sndr, Rcvr>` concept requires `Rcvr` to accept all of `Sndr`'s
    completions.

* `connect(sndr, rcvr)` also requires `rcvr` to accept all of `sndr`'s completions.

* `get_completion_signatures` is required to return an instantiation of the
    `completion_signatures` class template; the `value_types_of_t` and
    `error_types_of_t` template aliases remain.

* The `make_completion_signatures` design is slightly tweaked to be more general.

## Design Rationale ## {#design-rationale}

The author believes these are all reasonable adjustments to the design of P2300,
but one may wonder why they were not considered before now.

The fourth revision of P2300 brought with it some notable changes, the two most
significant of which are:

1. Support for dependently-typed senders, where a sender's completions can
    depend on information that isn't known independently of the execution
    environment within which the sender will be initiated. For instance,
    a `get_scheduler()` sender which queries the receiver for the current
    scheduler and then sends it through the value channel, cannot possibly
    know the type of the scheduler it will send until it has been connected
    to a receiver.

2. Dropping of support for "untyped" senders, which do not declare their
    completion signatures. Untyped senders were supported because of the lack
    of dependently-typed senders, which ceased to be an issue with R4. At the
    direction of LEWG, "untyped" senders were dropped, greatly simplifying
    the design.

Taken together, these two changes open up a huge piece of the design space. The
implication is that <b>a sender is <i>always</i> able to provide its completion
signatures.</b> This is new, and as of R4, P2300 is not taking advantage of this
extra type information.

The author realized that the extra type information can be leveraged to
accommodate LEWGs requests regarding the receiver interface, while at the same
time simplifying the design by permitting the library to take on more of the
type checking burden, thus freeing sender authors from needed to do so.

The `sender_to` concept, which checks whether a sender and a receiver can be
connected, now has perfect information: it can ask the receiver for the execution
environment; it can ask the sender how it will complete when initiated in that
environment; and it can ask the receiver if it is capable of receiving all of
the sender's possible completions. This was not possible before R4.

Below we look at each of the changes suggested in the summary and explain its
rationale in light of the extra information now available to the type system.

## Design blow-by-blow ## {#design-rationale}

### Remove the default implementation of the `get_env` receiver query. ### {#no-get-env-default}

The presence of a customization of `get_env` becomes the distinguishing feature
of receivers. A "receiver" no longer needs to provide any completion channels at
all to be considered a receiver, only `get_env`.

### The `receiver_of` concept takes a receiver and an instance of the `completion_signatures<>` class template.  ### {#receiver-of-completion-signatures}

The `receiver_of` concept, rather than accepting a receiver and some value
types, is changed to take a receiver and an instance of the
`completion_signatures<>` class template. A sender uses
`completion_signatures<>` to describe the signals with which it completes. The
`receiver_of` concept ensures that a particular receiver is capable of receiving
those signals.

Notably, if a sender only sends a value (i.e., can never send an error or a
stopped signal), then a receiver need only provide a value channel to be
compatible with it.

### A receiver's customization of `set_value` is required to be `noexcept`.  ### {#noexcept-set-value}

This makes it possible for many senders to become "no-fail"; that is, they
cannot complete with an error. `just(1)`, for instance, will only ever
successfully send an integer through the value channel. An adaptor such as
`then(sndr, fun)` can check whether `fun` can ever exit exceptionally when
called with all the sets of values that `sndr` may complete with. If so, the
`then` sender must add `set_error_t(exception_ptr)` to its list of completions.
Otherwise, it need not.

### The `sender_to<Sndr, Rcvr>` concept requires `Rcvr` to accept all of `Sndr`'s completions. ### {#sender-to-requirements}

The `sender_to` concept, which checks whether a sender and a receiver can be
connected, now enforces that the sender's completion signatures can in fact be
handled by the receiver. Previously, it only checked that `connect(sndr, rcvr)`
was well-formed, relying on sender authors to properly constrain their `connect`
customizations.

### `connect(sndr, rcvr)` also requires `rcvr` to accept all of `sndr`'s completions. ### {#connect-requirements}

For good measure, the `connect` customization point also checks whether a
receiver can receive all of the sender's possible completions before trying to
dispatch via `tag_invoke` to a `connect` customization. This often entirely
frees sender authors from having to constrain their `connect` customizations at
all. It is enough to customize `get_completion_signatures`, and the type
checking is done automatically.

Strictly speaking, with this change, the change to `sender_to` is unnecessary.
The change to `sender_to` results in better diagnostics, in the author's
experience.

### `get_completion_signatures` is required to return an instantiation of the `completion_signatures` class template. ### {#get-completion-signatures}

`get_completion_signatures` was added in R4 in response to feedback that
authoring sender traits was too difficult/arcane. Rather than defining a struct
with `template template` aliases, a user can simply declare a sender's
completions as:

```c++
execution::completion_signatures<
  execution::set_value_t(int),
  execution::set_error_t(std::exception_ptr),
  execution::set_stopped_t()>
```

In R4, `completion_signatures` generated the `template template` aliases for
you. The proposed change is to take it further and *require*
`get_completion_signatures` to return an instance of the `completion_signatures`
class template. With this change, the last vestige of the old sender traits
design with its unloved `temlate template` alias interface is swept away.
`completion_signatures` entirely replaces sender traits, further simplifying the
design.

The `sender` concept enforces the new requirement.

### The `value_types_of_t` and `error_types_of_t` template aliases remain. ### {#sender-traits-aliases}

It can still be helpful sometimes to *consume* the old `template template`, say,
for generating a variant of the tuples of all the sets of a sender's value
types. For that reason, the alias templates `value_types_of_t` and
`error_types_of_t` retain the same interface and semantic as before. For
instance, generating the variant of tuples of value types, you would use the
following:

  ```c++
  execution::value_types_of_t<
    Sndr,
    Env,
    std::tuple,
    std::variant>;
  ```

Additionally, these two alias joined by a `sends_stopped<Sndr, Env>` Boolean
variable template to complete the set.

### The `make_completion_signatures` design is slightly tweaked to be more general. ### {#make-completion-signatures}

In the proposed design, `completion_signatures` plays a much larger role.
Accordingly, the job of specifying the completion signatures of custom sender
adaptors also becomes more important, necessitating better tools. The
`make_completion_signatures`, new to R4, narrowly misses being that better tool.

In R4, `make_completion_signatures` has the following interface:

    <pre highlight="c++">
    template &lt;
      execution::sender Sndr,
      class Env = execution::no_env,
      class OtherSigs = execution::completion_signatures&lt;>,
      template &lt;class...> class SetValue = <i>default-set-value</i>,
      template &lt;class> class SetError = <i>default-set-error</i>,
      bool SendsStopped = execution::completion_signatures_of_t&lt;Sndr, Env>::sends_stopped>
        requires sender&lt;Sndr, Env>
    using make_completion_signatures =
      execution::completion_signatures&lt;/* see below */>;
    </pre>

In the R4 design, `SetValue` and `SetError` are alias templates, instantiations
of which are required to name function types whose return types are
`excecution::set_value_t` and `execution::set_error_t`, respectively. This is
overly-restrictive. The problems with it are:

1. It is not possible to map one kind of completion into a different kind. For
    instance, the `upon_error(sndr, fun)` maps error completions into value
    completions.

2. It is not possible to map a single completion signature into multiple
    different completions. For instance, the `let_value(sndr, fun)` sender
    adaptor needs to map a set of `sndr`'s value types into the set of
    completions of whatever sender that is returned from `fun(values...)`, which
    is likely more than one.

In addition, the final Boolean `SendsStopped` parameter merely controls whether
or not the completion `execution::set_stopped_t()` should be added to the
resulting list of completion signatures. This doesn't help a sender adaptor
such as `let_stopped(sndr, fun)`, which needs to transform a stopped signal
into the set of completions of the sender that `fun()` returns.

This design proposes to change the three final template arguments as follows:

* <u><b>`template <class...> class SetValue`:</b></u> Instantiations of this alias
    template must name an instantiation of the `completion_signatures` class
    template.

* <u><b>`template <class> class SetError`:</b></u> Instantiations of this alias
    template must name an instantiation of the `completion_signatures` class
    template.

* <u><b>`class SetStopped`:</b></u> Must name an instantiation of the
    `completion_signatures` class template. If the sender `Sndr` can complete
    with `set_stopped`, then these signatures are included in the resulting list
    of completions. Otherwise, this template parameter is ignored.

The semantics of `make_completion_signatures` is likewise simplified: The three
template arguments, `SetValue`, `SetError`, and `SetStopped`, are used to map
each of a sender's completions into a list of completions which are all
concatenated together, along with any additional signatures specified by the
`OtherSigs` list, and made unique.

## Considerations ## {#considerations}

### Implications of `noexcept` `set_value` ### {#nothrow-set-value}

The role of `execution::set_value` is to execute a continuation on the success
of the predecessor. A continuation is arbitrary code, and surely arbitrary code
can exit exceptionally, so how can we require `execution::set_value` to be
`noexcept`?

The answer has two parts:

1. `execution::set_value` always has the option of accepting arguments by
    forwarding reference and executing any potentially throwing operations
    within a `try`/`catch` block, routing any exceptions to
    `set_error(std::exception_ptr)`.

2. A sender knows what types it will send and with what value category. The
    `sender_to` concept checks that none of the `set_value` expression(s) it
    will execute are potentially throwing. This doesn't necessitate that all
    receivers accept all arguments by forwarding reference, however. For
    instance, if a sender knows it will pass an rvalue `std::string` to the
    receiver's `set_value`, and if the sender is connected to a receiver whose
    `set_value` takes a `std::string` by value, that will type-check. The
    `sender_to` concept will essentially be enforcing this constraint:

        <pre highlight="c++">
        requires (Receiver rcvr) {
          { execution::set_value(std::move(rcvr), std::string()) } noexcept;
        }
        </pre>

        Since `std::string`'s move constructor is `noexcept`, this constraint
        is satisfied regardless of whether `rcvr`'s `set_value` customization
        accepts the string by value or by reference.

### Diagnostics ### {#diagnostics}

On the whole, the authors of P2300 feel that this design change is the right one
to make to meet LEWG's requirements. It comes with one drawback, however: The
satisfaction checking of the `receiver_of` concept, which must now check against
a set of signatures specified in a type-list, now requires metaprogramming in
addition to `requires` clauses. As a result, diagnostics can suffer.

During the implementation experience, the author was able to surface a
relatively suscinct and accurate error for, say, the lack of a particular
completion channel on a receiver, by employing several tricks. While regrettable
that such tricks are required, we do not feel that the issue of mediocre
diagnostics is dire enough to offset the many advantages of the design presented
here.

In addition, the author has discovered a way that an implementation may choose
to extend the `connect` customization point in a way that permits users to
bypass the constraint checking entirely, thus generating a deep instantiation
backtrace that often greatly assists the debugging of custom
sender/receiver-based algorithms. This mechanism can be enshrined in the standard
as "recommended practice."

## Open questions ## {#open-questions}

### Weasel wording for `-fno-exceptions` ### {#fno-exceptions}

We may need to add some weasel wording to the effect that:

> ... if an implementation is able to deduce that all of its operations are not
> potentially throwing, a conforming implementation of the algorithms in
> &lt;section> may omit set_error_t(exception_ptr) from any sender's list of
> completion signatures.

If an implementation doesn't support exceptions, e.g., if the user is compiling
with `-fno-exceptions`, it can safely assume that an expression `expr` is not
going to exit exceptionally regardless of the value of `noexcept(expr)`. An
implementation shouldn't be required to report that it can complete with an
exception in that case.

### Error channel of allocating algorithms ### {#allocations}

An interesting question is what to do on freestanding implementations for those
algorithms that necessarily must allocate. Those algorithms, as P2300 stands
today, will always have a `set_error_t(exception_ptr)` completion signature. The
possibilities I see are:

* Permit implementations to omit the exceptional completion signature when it
    knows allocations can't fail with an exception (see above),

* Replace the exceptional completion signature with
    `set_error_t(std::error_code)`, and call the receiver with
    `std::make_error_code(std::errc::not_enough_memory)` on allocation failure.

* Replace the exceptional completion signature with
    `set_error_t(std::bad_alloc)`; that is, pass an instance of the
    `std::bad_alloc` exception type through the error channel by value. (From
    what the author can infer, freestanding implementations are required to
    provide the `std::bad_alloc` type even when actually throwing exceptions is
    not supported.)

## Implementation experience ## {#implementation-experience}

The design described above has been implemented in a branch of the reference
implementation which can be found in the following GitHub pull request:
https://github.com/brycelelbach/wg21_p2300_std_execution/pull/410.

The change, while somewhat disruptive to the reference implementation itself,
had the benefits described above; namely:

* Stricter type-checking "for free". Sender authors need only report the
    completion signatures, and the concepts and customization points of the
    library do all the heavy lifting to make sure the capabilities of receivers
    match the requirements of the senders.

* More "no-fail" senders. Many fewer of the senders need an error channel at
    all, and the ones that do generally need it only conditionally, when working
    with potentially-thrwoing callables or types whose special operations can
    throw. Only those few senders that must dynamically allocate state necessarily
    need a `set_error_t(exception_ptr)` channel, and we may even choose to change
    those to use something like `set_error_t(bad_alloc)` instead.

* No required `set_error_t(exception_ptr)` or `set_stopped_t()` channels at all.

In addition, in the author's opinion, the reference implementation got
significantly *simpler* for the change, and the pull request removes more lines
than it adds, while adding functionality at the same time.
