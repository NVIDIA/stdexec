# Introduction # {#intro}

This paper proposes a self-contained design for a Standard C++ framework for managing asynchronous execution on generic execution contexts. It is based on the ideas in [[P0443R14]] and its companion papers.

## Motivation ## {#motivation}

Today, C++ software is increasingly asynchronous and parallel, a trend that is likely to only continue going forward.
Asynchrony and parallelism appears everywhere, from processor hardware interfaces, to networking, to file I/O, to GUIs, to accelerators.
Every C++ domain and every platform need to deal with asynchrony and parallelism, from scientific computing to video games to financial services, from the smallest mobile devices to your laptop to GPUs in the world's fastest supercomputer.

While the C++ Standard Library has a rich set concurrency primitives (`std::atomic`, `std::mutex`, `std::counting_semaphore`, etc) and lower level building blocks (`std::thread`, etc), we lack a Standard vocabulary and framework for asynchrony and parallelism that C++ programmers desperately need.
`std::async`/`std::future`/`std::promise`, C++11's intended exposure for asynchrony, is inefficient, hard to use correctly, and severely lacking in genericity, making it unusable in many contexts.
We introduced parallel algorithms to the C++ Standard Library in C++17, and while they are an excellent start, they are all inherently synchronous and not composable.

This paper proposes a Standard C++ model for asynchrony, based around three key abstractions: schedulers, senders, and receivers, and a set of customizable asynchronous algorithms.

## Priorities ## {#priorities}

* Be composable and generic, allowing users to write code that can be used with many different types of execution contexts.
* Encapsulate common asynchronous patterns in customizable and reusable algorithms, so users don't have to invent things themselves.
* Make it easy to be correct by construction.
* Support both lazy and eager execution in a way that does not compromise the efficiency of either and allows users to write code that is agnostic to eagerness.
* Support the diversity of execution contexts and execution agents, because not all execution agents are created equal; some are less capable than others, but not less important.
* Allow everything to be customized by an execution context, including transfer to other execution contexts, but don't require that execution contexts customize everything.
* Care about all reasonable use cases, domains and platforms.
* Errors must be propagated, but error handling must not present a burden.
* Support cancellation, which is not an error.
* Have clear and concise answers for where things execute.
* Be able to manage and terminate the lifetimes of objects asynchronously.

## Examples ## {#example}

See [[#design-sender-factories]], [[#design-sender-adaptors]], and [[#design-sender-consumers]] for short explanations of the algorithms used in these code examples.

### Hello world ### {#example-hello-world}

```c++
using namespace std::execution;

scheduler auto sch = get_thread_pool().scheduler();                           // 1

sender auto begin = schedule(sch);                                            // 2
sender auto hi_again = then(begin, []{                                        // 3
    std::cout << "Hello world! Have an int.";                                 // 3
    return 13;                                                                // 3
});                                                                           // 3
sender auto add_42 = then(hi_again, [](int arg) { return arg + 42; });        // 4

auto [i] = this_thread::sync_wait(add_42).value();                            // 5
```

This example demonstrates the basics of schedulers, senders, and receivers:

1. First we need to get a scheduler from somewhere, such as a thread pool. A scheduler is a lightweight handle to an execution resource.
2. To start a chain of work on a scheduler, we call [[#design-sender-factory-schedule]], which returns a sender that completes on the scheduler.  sender describes asynchronous work and sends a signal (value, error, or done) to some recipient(s) when that work completes.
3. We use sender algorithms to produce senders and compose asynchronous work. [[#design-sender-adaptor-then]] is a sender adaptor that takes an input sender and a `std::invocable`, and calls the `std::invocable` on the signal sent by the input sender. The sender returned by `then` sends the result of that invocation. In this case, the input sender came from `schedule`, so its `void`, meaning it won't send us a value, so our `std::invocable` takes no parameters. But we return an `int`, which will be sent to the next recipient.
4. Now, we add another operation to the chain, again using [[#design-sender-adaptor-then]]. This time, we get sent a value - the `int` from the previous step. We add `42` to it, and then return the result.
5. Finally, we're ready to submit the entire asynchronous pipeline and wait for its completion. Everything up until this point has been completely asynchronous; the work may not have even started yet. To ensure the work has started and then block pending its completion, we use [[#design-sender-consumer-sync_wait]], which will either return a `std::optional<std::tuple<...>>` with the value sent by the last sender, or an empty `std::optional` if the last sender sent a done signal, or it throws an exception if the last sender sent an error.

### Asynchronous inclusive scan ### {#example-async-inclusive-scan}

```c++
using namespace std::execution;

sender auto async_inclusive_scan(scheduler auto sch,                          // 2
                                 std::span<const double> input,               // 1
                                 std::span<double> output,                    // 1
                                 double init,                                 // 1
                                 std::size_t tile_count)                      // 3
{
  std::size_t const tile_size = (input.size() + tile_count - 1) / tile_count;

  std::vector<double> partials(tile_count + 1);                               // 4
  partials[0] = init;                                                         // 4

  return transfer_just(sch, std::move(partials))                              // 5
       | bulk(tile_count,                                                     // 6
           [=](std::size_t i, std::vector<double>& partials) {                // 7
             auto start = i * tile_size;                                      // 8
             auto end   = std::min(input.size(), (i + 1) * tile_size);        // 8
             partials[i + 1] = *--std::inclusive_scan(begin(input) + start,   // 9
                                                      begin(input) + end,     // 9
                                                      begin(output) + start); // 9
           })                                                                 // 10
       | then(                                                                // 11
           [](std::vector<double>& partials) {
             std::inclusive_scan(begin(partials), end(partials),              // 12
                                 begin(partials));                            // 12
             return std::move(partials);                                      // 13
           })
       | bulk(tile_count,                                                     // 14
           [=](std::size_t i, std::vector<double>& partials) {                // 14
             auto start = i * tile_size;                                      // 14
             auto end   = std::min(input.size(), (i + 1) * tile_size);        // 14
             std::for_each(output + start, output + end,                      // 14
               [&] (double& e) { e = partials[i] + e; }                       // 14
             );
           })
       | then(                                                                // 15
           [=](std::vector<double>& partials) {                               // 15
             return output;                                                   // 15
           });                                                                // 15
}
```

This example builds an asynchronous computation of an inclusive scan:

1. It scans a sequence of `double`s (represented as the `std::span<const double>` `input`) and stores the result in another sequence of `double`s (represented as `std::span<double>` `output`).
2. It takes a scheduler, which specifies what execution context the scan should be launched on.
3. It also takes a `tile_count` parameter that controls the number of execution agents that will be spawned.
4. First we need to allocate temporary storage needed for the algorithm, which we'll do with a `std::vector`, `partials`. We need one `double` of temporary storage for each execution agent we create.
5. Next we'll create our initial sender with [[#design-sender-factory-transfer_just]]. This sender will send the temporary storage, which we've moved into the sender. The sender has a completion scheduler of `sch`, which means the next item in the chain will use `sch`.
6. Senders and sender adaptors support composition via `operator|`, similar to C++ ranges. We'll use `operator|` to attach the next piece of work, which will spawn `tile_count` execution agents using [[#design-sender-adaptor-bulk]] (see [[#design-pipeable]] for details).
7. Each agent will call a `std::invocable`, passing it two arguments. The first is the agent's index (`i`) in the [[#design-sender-adaptor-bulk]] operation, in this case a unique integer in `[0, tile_count)`. The second argument is what the input sender sent - the temporary storage.
8. We start by computing the start and end of the range of input and output elements that this agent is responsible for, based on our agent index.
9. Then we do a sequential `std::inclusive_scan` over our elements. We store the scan result for our last element, which is the sum of all of our elements, in our temporary storage `partials`.
10. After all computation in that initial [[#design-sender-adaptor-bulk]] pass has completed, every one of the spawned execution agents will have written the sum of its elements into its slot in `partials`.
11. Now we need to scan all of the values in `partials`. We'll do that with a single execution agent which will execute after the [[#design-sender-adaptor-bulk]] completes. We create that execution agent with [[#design-sender-adaptor-then]].
12. [[#design-sender-adaptor-then]] takes an input sender and an `std::invocable` and calls the `std::invocable` with the value sent by the input sender. Inside our `std::invocable`, we call `std::inclusive_scan` on `partials`, which the input senders will send to us.
13. Then we return `partials`, which the next phase will need.
14. Finally we do another [[#design-sender-adaptor-bulk]] of the same shape as before. In this [[#design-sender-adaptor-bulk]], we will use the scanned values in `partials` to integrate the sums from other tiles into our elements, completing the inclusive scan.
15. `async_inclusive_scan` returns a sender that sends the output `std::span<double>`. A consumer of the algorithm can chain additional work that uses the scan result. At the point at which `async_inclusive_scan` returns, the computation may not have completed. In fact, it may not have even started.

### Asynchronous dynamically-sized read ### {#example-async-dynamically-sized-read}

```c++
using namespace std::execution;

sender_of<std::size_t> auto async_read(                                       // 1
    sender_of<std::span<std::byte>> auto buffer,                              // 1
    auto handle);                                                             // 1

struct dynamic_buffer {                                                       // 3
  std::unique_ptr<std::byte[]> data;                                          // 3
  std::size_t size;                                                           // 3
};                                                                            // 3

sender_of<dynamic_buffer> auto async_read_array(auto handle) {                // 2
  return just(dynamic_buffer{})                                               // 4
       | let_value([] (dynamic_buffer& buf) {                                 // 5
           return just(std::as_writeable_bytes(std::span(&buf.size, 1))       // 6
                | async_read(handle)                                          // 7
                | then(                                                       // 8
                    [&] (std::size_t bytes_read) {                            // 9
                      assert(bytes_read == sizeof(buf.size));                 // 10
                      buf.data = std::make_unique(new std::byte[buf.size]);   // 11
                      return std::span(buf.data.get(), buf.size);             // 12
                    }
                | async_read(handle)                                          // 13
                | then(
                    [&] (std::size_t bytes_read) {
                      assert(bytes_read == buf.size);                         // 14
                      return std::move(buf);                                  // 15
                    });
       });
}
```

This example demonstrates a common asynchronous I/O pattern - reading a payload of a dynamic size by first reading the size, then reading the number of bytes specified by the size:

1. `async_read` is a pipeable sender adaptor. It's a customization point object, but this is what it's call signature looks like. It takes a sender parameter which must send an input buffer in the form of a `std::span<std::byte>`, and a handle to an I/O context. It will asynchronously read into the input buffer, up to the size of the `std::span`. It returns a sender which will send the number of bytes read once the read completes.
2. `async_read_array` takes an I/O handle and reads a size from it, and then a buffer of that many bytes. It returns a sender that sends a `dynamic_buffer` object that owns the data that was sent.
3. `dynamic_buffer` is an aggregate struct that contains a `std::unique_ptr<std::byte[]>` and a size.
4. The first thing we do inside of `async_read_array` is create a sender that will send a new, empty `dynamic_array` object using [[#design-sender-factory-just]]. We can attach more work to the pipeline using `operator|` composition (see [[#design-pipeable]] for details).
5. We need the lifetime of this `dynamic_array` object to last for the entire pipeline. So, we use `let_value`, which takes an input sender and a `std::invocable` that must return a sender itself (see [[#design-sender-adaptor-let]] for details). `let_value` sends the value from the input sender to the `std::invocable`. Critically, the lifetime of the sent object will last until the sender returned by the `std::invocable` completes.
6. Inside of the `let_value` `std::invocable`, we have the rest of our logic. First, we want to initiate an `async_read` of the buffer size. To do that, we need to send a `std::span` pointing to `buf.size`. We can do that with [[#design-sender-factory-just]].
7. We chain the `async_read` onto the [[#design-sender-factory-just]] sender with `operator|`.
8. Next, we pipe a `std::invocable` that will be invoked after the `async_read` completes using [[#design-sender-adaptor-then]].
9. That `std::invocable` gets sent the number of bytes read.
10. We need to check that the number of bytes read is what we expected.
11. Now that we have read the size of the data, we can allocate storage for it.
12. We return a `std::span<std::byte>` to the storage for the data from the `std::invocable`. This will be sent to the next recipient in the pipeline.
13. And that recipient will be another `async_read`, which will read the data.
14. Once the data has been read, in another [[#design-sender-adaptor-then]], we confirm that we read the right number of bytes.
15. Finally, we move out of and return our `dynamic_buffer` object. It will get sent by the sender returned by `async_read_array`. We can attach more things to that sender to use the data in the buffer.

## What this proposal is **not** ## {#intro-is-not}

This paper is not a patch on top of [[P0443R14]]; we are not asking to update the existing paper, we are asking to retire it in favor of this paper, which is already self-contained; any example code within this paper can be written in Standard C++, without the need
to standardize any further facilities.

This paper is not an alternative design to [[P0443R14]]; rather, we have taken the design in the current executors paper, and applied targeted fixes to allow it to fulfill the promises of the sender/receiver model, as well as provide all the facilities we consider
essential when writing user code using standard execution concepts; we have also applied the guidance of removing one-way executors from the paper entirely, and instead provided an algorithm based around senders that serves the same purpose.

## Design changes from P0443 ## {#intro-compare}

1. The `executor` concept has been removed and all of its proposed functionality is now based on schedulers and senders, as per SG1 direction.
2. Properties are not included in this paper. We see them as a possible future extension, if the committee gets more comfortable with them.
3. Users now have a choice between using a strictly lazy vs a possibly eager version of most sender algorithms.
4. Senders now advertise what scheduler, if any, their evaluation will complete on.
5. The places of execution of user code in P0443 weren't precisely defined, whereas they are in this paper. See [[#design-propagation]].
6. P0443 did not propose a suite of sender algorithms necessary for writing sender code; this paper does. See [[#design-sender-factories]], [[#design-sender-adaptors]], and [[#design-sender-consumers]].
7. P0443 did not specify the semantics of variously qualified `connect` overloads; this paper does. See [[#design-shot]].
8. Specific type erasure facilities are omitted, as per LEWG direction. Type erasure facilities can be built on top of this proposal, as discussed in [[#design-dispatch]].
9. A specific thread pool implementation is omitted, as per LEWG direction.

## Prior art ## {#intro-prior-art}

This proposal builds upon and learns from years of prior art with asynchronous and parallel programming frameworks in C++.

Futures, as traditionally realized, require the dynamic allocation and management of a shared state, synchronization, and typically type-erasure of work and continuation. Many of these costs are inherent in the nature of "future" as a handle to work that is already scheduled for execution. These expenses rule out the future abstraction for many uses and makes it a poor choice for a basis of a generic mechanism.

Coroutines suffer many of the same problems, but can avoid synchronizing when chaining dependent work because they typically start suspended. In many cases, coroutine frames require unavoidable dynamic allocation. Consequently, coroutines in embedded or heterogeneous environments require great attention to detail. Nor are coroutines good candidates for cancellation because the early and safe termination of coroutines requires unsatisfying solutions. On the one hand, exceptions are inefficient and disallowed in many environments. Alternatively, clumsy ad-hoc mechanisms, whereby `co_yield` returns a status code, hinder correctness. See [[P1662R0]] for a complete discussion.

Callbacks are the simplest, most powerful, and most efficient mechanism for creating chains of work, but suffer problems of their own. Callbacks must propagate either errors or values. This simple requirement yields many different interface possibilities, but the lack of a standard obstructs generic design. Additionally, few of these possibilities accommodate cancellation signals when the user requests upstream work to stop and clean up.

## Field experience ## {#intro-field-experience}

This proposal draws heavily from our field experience with [libunifex](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex), [Thrust](https://github.com/NVIDIA/thrust), and [Agency](https://github.com/agency-library/agency). It is also inspired by the needs of countless other C++ frameworks for asynchrony, parallelism, and concurrency, including:
* <a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx">HPX</a>
* [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/Futures.md)
* [stlab](https://stlab.cc/libraries/concurrency/)

Before this proposal is approved, we will present a new implementation of this proposal written from the specification and intended as a contribution to libc++. This implementation will demonstrate the viability of the design across the use cases and execution contexts that the committee has identified as essential.

# Design - introduction # {#design-intro}

The following four sections describe the entirety of the proposed design.

* [[#design-intro]] describes the conventions used through the rest of the design sections, as well as an example illustrating how we envision code will be written using this proposal.
* [[#design-user]] describes all the functionality from the perspective we intend for users: it describes the various concepts they will interact with, and what their programming model is.
* [[#design-implementer]] describes the machinery that allows for that programming model to function, and the information contained there is necessary for people implementing senders and sender algorithms (including the standard library ones) - but is not necessary to use senders productively.

## Conventions ## {#design-conventions}

The following conventions are used throughout the design section:

  1. The namespace proposed in this paper is the same as in [[P0443R14]]: `std::execution`; however, for brevity, the `std::` part of this name is omitted. When you see `execution::foo`, treat that as `std::execution::foo`.
  2. Universal references and explicit calls to `std::move`/`std::forward` are omitted in code samples and signatures for simplicity; assume universal references and perfect forwarding unless stated otherwise.
  3. None of the names proposed here are names that we are particularly attached to; consider the names to be reasonable placeholders that can freely be changed, should the committee want to do so.

## Queries and algorithms ## {#design-queries-and-algorithms}

A <dfn>query</dfn> is a `std::invocable` that takes some set of objects (usually one) as parameters and returns facts about those objects without modifying them. Queries are usually customization point objects, but in some cases may be functions.

An <dfn>algorithm</dfn> is a `std::invocable` that takes some set of objects as parameters and causes those objects to do something. Algorithms are usually customization point objects, but in some cases may be functions.

# Design - user side # {#design-user}

## Execution contexts describe the place of execution ## {#design-contexts}

An <dfn>execution context</dfn> is a resource that represents the *place* where execution will happen. This could be a concrete resource - like a specific thread pool object, or a GPU - or a more abstract one, like the current thread of execution. Execution contexts
don't need to have a representation in code; they are simply a term describing certain properties of execution of a function.

## Schedulers represent execution contexts ## {#design-schedulers}

A <dfn>scheduler</dfn> is a lightweight handle that represents a strategy for scheduling work onto an *execution context*. Since execution contexts don't necessarily manifest in C++ code, it's not possible to program
directly against their API. A scheduler is a solution to that problem: the scheduler concept is defined by a single sender algorithm, `schedule`, which returns a sender that will complete on an execution context determined
by the scheduler. Logic that you want to run on that context can be placed in the receiver's completion-signalling method.

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::scheduler auto sch = get_thread_pool().scheduler();
execution::sender auto snd = execution::schedule(sch);
// snd is a sender (see below) describing the creation of a new execution resource
// on the execution context associated with sch
</pre>

Note that a particular scheduler type may provide other kinds of scheduling operations
which are supported by its associated execution context. It is not limited to scheduling
purely using the `execution::schedule` API.

Future papers will propose additional scheduler concepts that extend `scheduler`
to add other capabilities. For example:
* A `time_scheduler` concept that extends `scheduler` to support time-based scheduling.
    Such a concept might provide access to `schedule_after(sched, duration)`, `schedule_at(sched, time_point)` and `now(sched)` APIs.
* Concepts that extend `scheduler` to support opening, reading and writing files asynchronously.
* Concepts that extend `scheduler` to support connecting, sending data and receiving data over the network asynchronously.

## Senders describe work ## {#design-senders}

A <dfn>sender</dfn> is an object that describes work. Senders are similar to futures in existing asynchrony designs, but unlike futures, the work that is being done to arrive at the values they will *send* is also directly described by the sender object itself. A
sender is said to <dfn>send</dfn> some values if a receiver connected (see [[#design-connect]]) to that sender will eventually *receive* said values.

The primary defining sender algorithm is [[#design-connect]]; this function, however, is not a user-facing API; it is used to facilitate communication between senders and various sender algorithms, but end user code is not expected to invoke
it directly.

The way user code is expected to interact with senders is by using [=sender algorithms=].
This paper proposes an initial set of such sender algorithms, which are described in [[#design-composable]], [[#design-sender-factories]], [[#design-sender-adaptors]], and [[#design-sender-consumers]].
For example, here is how a user can create a new sender on a scheduler, attach a continuation to it, and then wait for execution of the continuation to complete:

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::scheduler auto sch = get_thread_pool().scheduler();
execution::sender auto snd = execution::schedule(sch);
execution::sender auto cont = execution::then(snd, []{
    std::fstream file{ "result.txt" };
    file << compute_result;
});

this_thread::sync_wait(cont);
// at this point, cont has completed execution
</pre>

## Senders are composable through sender algorithms ## {#design-composable}

Asynchronous programming often departs from traditional code structure and control flow that we are familiar with.
A successful asynchronous framework must provide an intuitive story for composition of asynchronous work: expressing dependencies, passing objects, managing object lifetimes, etc.

The true power and utility of senders is in their composability.
With senders, users can describe generic execution pipelines and graphs, and then run them on and across a variety of different schedulers.
Senders are composed using <dfn>sender algorithms</dfn>:

* [=sender factories=], algorithms that take no senders and return a sender.
* [=sender adaptors=], algorithms that take (and potentially `execution::connect`) senders and return a sender.
* [=sender consumers=], algorithms that take (and potentially `execution::connect`) senders and do not return a sender.

## Senders can propagate completion schedulers ## {#design-propagation}

One of the goals of executors is to support a diverse set of execution contexts, including traditional thread pools, task and fiber frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx">HPX</a>) and [Legion](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion)), and GPUs and other accelerators (managed by runtimes such as CUDA or SYCL).
On many of these systems, not all execution agents are created equal and not all functions can be run on all execution agents.
Having precise control over the execution context used for any given function call being submitted is important on such systems, and the users of standard execution facilities will expect to be able to express such requirements.

[[P0443R14]] was not always clear about the <i>place of execution</i> of any given piece of code.
Precise control was present in the two-way execution API present in earlier executor designs, but it has so far been missing from the senders design. There has been a proposal ([[P1897R3]]) to provide a number of sender algorithms that would enforce certain rules on the places of execution
of the work described by a sender, but we have found those sender algorithms to be insufficient for achieving the best performance on all platforms that are of interest to us. The implementation strategies that we are aware of result in one of the following situations:

  1. trying to submit work to one execution context (such as a CPU thread pool) from another execution context (such as a GPU or a task framework), which assumes that all execution agents are as capable as a `std::thread` (which they aren't).
  2. forcibly interleaving two adjacent execution graph nodes that are both executing on one execution context (such as a GPU) with glue code that runs on another execution context (such as a CPU), which is prohibitively expensive for some execution contexts (such as CUDA or SYCL).
  3. having to customise most or all sender algorithms to support an execution context, so that you can avoid problems described in 1. and 2, which we believe is impractical and brittle based on months of field experience attempting this in [Agency](https://github.com/agency-library/agency).

None of these implementation strategies are acceptable for many classes of parallel runtimes, such as task frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx">HPX</a>) or accelerator runtimes (like CUDA or SYCL).

Therefore, in addition to the `on` sender algorithm from [[P1897R3]], we are proposing a way for senders to advertise what scheduler (and by extension what execution context) they will complete on.
Any given sender <b>may</b> have <dfn>completion schedulers</dfn> for some or all of the signals (value, error, or done) it completes with (for more detail on the completion signals, see [[#design-receivers]]).
When further work is attached to that sender by invoking sender algorithms, that work will also complete on an appropriate completion scheduler.

### `execution::get_completion_scheduler` ### {#design-sender-query-get_completion_scheduler}

`get_completion_scheduler` is a query that retrieves the [=completion scheduler=] for a specific completion signal from a sender.
Calling `get_completion_scheduler` on a sender that does not have a completion scheduler for a given signal is ill-formed.
If a sender advertises a completion scheduler for a signal in this way, that sender <b>must</b> ensure that it [=send|sends=] that signal on an execution agent belonging to an execution context represented by a scheduler returned from this function.
See [[#design-propagation]] for more details.

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::scheduler auto cpu_sched = new_thread_scheduler{};
execution::scheduler auto gpu_sched = cuda::scheduler();

execution::sender auto snd0 = execution::schedule(cpu_sched);
execution::scheduler auto completion_sch0 =
  execution::get_completion_scheduler&lt;execution::set_value_t>(snd0);
// completion_sch0 is equivalent to cpu_sched

execution::sender auto snd1 = execution::then(snd0, []{
    std::cout << "I am running on cpu_sched!\n";
});
execution::scheduler auto completion_sch1 =
  execution::get_completion_scheduler&lt;execution::set_value_t>(snd1);
// completion_sch1 is equivalent to cpu_sched

execution::sender auto snd2 = execution::transfer(snd1, gpu_sched);
execution::sender auto snd3 = execution::then(snd2, []{
    std::cout << "I am running on gpu_sched!\n";
});
execution::scheduler auto completion_sch3 =
  execution::get_completion_scheduler&lt;execution::set_value_t>(snd3);
// completion_sch3 is equivalent to gpu_sched
</pre>

## Execution context transitions are explicit ## {#design-transitions}

[[P0443R14]] does not contain any mechanisms for performing an execution context transition. The only sender algorithm that can create a sender that will move execution to a *specific* execution context is `execution::schedule`, which does not take an input sender.
That means that there's no way to construct sender chains that traverse different execution contexts. This is necessary to fulfill the promise of senders being able to replace two-way executors, which had this capability.

We propose that, for senders advertising their [=completion scheduler=], all execution context transitions <b>must</b> be explicit; running user code anywhere but where they defined it to run <b>must</b> be considered a bug.

The `execution::transfer` sender adaptor performs a transition from one execution context to another:

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::scheduler auto sch1 = ...;
execution::scheduler auto sch2 = ...;

execution::sender auto snd1 = execution::schedule(sch1);
execution::sender auto then1 = execution::then(snd1, []{
    std::cout << "I am running on sch1!\n";
});

execution::sender auto snd2 = execution::transfer(then1, sch2);
execution::sender auto then2 = execution::then(snd2, []{
    std::cout << "I am running on sch2!\n";
});

this_thread::sync_wait(then2);
</pre>

## Senders can be either multi-shot or single-shot ## {#design-shot}

Some senders may only support launching their operation a single time, while others may be repeatable
and support being launched multiple times. Executing the operation may consume resources owned by the
sender.

For example, a sender may contain a `std::unique_ptr` that it will be transferring ownership of to the
operation-state returned by a call to `execution::connect` so that the operation has access to
this resource. In such a sender, calling `execution::connect` consumes the sender such that after
the call the input sender is no longer valid. Such a sender will also typically be move-only so that
it can maintain unique ownership of that resource.

A <dfn>single-shot sender</dfn> can only be connected to a receiver at most once. Its implementation of
`execution::connect` only has overloads for an rvalue-qualified sender. Callers must pass the sender
as an rvalue to the call to `execution::connect`, indicating that the call consumes the sender.

A <dfn>multi-shot sender</dfn> can be connected to multiple receivers and can be launched multiple
times. Mult-shot senders customise `execution::connect` to accept an lvalue reference to the
sender. Callers can indicate that they want the sender to remain valid after the call to `execution::connect`
by passing an lvalue reference to the sender to call these overloads. Multi-shot senders should also define
overloads of `execution::connect` that accept rvalue-qualified enders to allow the sender to be also used in places
where only a single-shot sender is required.

If the user of a sender does not require the sender to remain valid after connecting it to a
receiver then it can pass an rvalue-reference to the sender to the call to `execution::connect`.
Such usages should be able to accept either single-shot or multi-shot senders.

If the caller does wish for the sender to remain valid after the call then it can pass an lvalue-qualified sender
to the call to `execution::connect`. Such usages will only accept multi-shot senders.

Algorithms that accept senders will typically either decay-copy an input sender and store it somewhere
for later usage (for example as a data-member of the returned sender) or will immediately call
`execution::connect` on the input sender, such as in `this_thread::sync_wait` or `execution::start_detached`.

Some multi-use sender algorithms may require that an input sender be copy-constructible but will only call
`execution::connect` on an rvalue of each copy, which still results in effectively executing the operation multiple times.
Other multi-use sender algorithms may require that the sender is move-constructible but will invoke `execution::connect`
on an lvalue reference to the sender.

For a sender to be usable in both multi-use scenarios, it will generally be required to be both copy-constructible and lvalue-connectable.

## Senders are forkable ## {#design-forkable}

Any non-trivial program will eventually want to fork a chain of senders into independent streams of work, regardless of whether they are single-shot or multi-shot.
For instance, an incoming event to a middleware system may be required to trigger events on more than one downstream system.
This requires that we provide well defined mechanisms for making sure that connecting a sender multiple times is possible and correct.

The `split` sender adaptor facilitates connecting to a sender multiple times, regardless of whether it is single-shot or multi-shot:

<pre highlight=c++>
auto some_algorithm(execution::sender auto&& input) {
    execution::sender auto multi_shot = split(input);
    // "multi_shot" is guaranteed to be multi-shot,
    // regardless of whether "input" was multi-shot or not

    return when_all(
      then(multi_shot, [] { std::cout << "First continuation\n"; }),
      then(multi_shot, [] { std::cout << "Second continuation\n"; })
    );
}
</pre>

## Senders are joinable ## {#design-join}

Similarly to how it's hard to write a complex program that will eventually want to fork sender chains into independent streams, it's also hard to write a program that does not want to eventually create join nodes, where multiple independent streams of execution are
merged into a single one in an asynchronous fashion.

`when_all` is a sender adaptor that returns a sender that completes when the last of the input senders completes. It [=send|sends=] a pack of values, where the elements of said pack are the values sent by the input senders, in order. `when_all` returns a sender that also does not have an associated scheduler.

`transfer_when_all` accepts an additional scheduler argument. It returns a sender whose value [=completion scheduler=] is the scheduler provided as an argument, but otherwise behaves the same as `when_all`. You can think of it as a composition of
`transfer(when_all(inputs...), scheduler)`, but one that allows for better efficiency through customization.

## Schedulers advertise their forward progress guarantees ## {#design-fpg}

To decide whether a scheduler (and its associated execution context) is sufficient for a specific task, it may be necessary to know what kind of forward progress guarantees it provides for the execution agents it creates. The C++ Standard defines the following
forward progress guarantees:

* <i>concurrent</i>, which requires that a thread makes progress <i>eventually</i>;
* <i>parallel</i>, which requires that a thread makes progress once it executes a step; and
* <i>weakly parallel</i>, which does not require that the thread makes progress.

This paper introduces a scheduler query function, `get_forward_progress_guarantee`, which returns one of the enumerators of a new `enum` type, `forward_progress_guarantee`. Each enumerator of `forward_progress_guarantee` corresponds to one of the aforementioned
guarantees.

## Most sender adaptors are pipeable ## {#design-pipeable}

To facilitate an intuitive syntax for composition, most sender adaptors are <dfn>pipeable</dfn>; they can be composed (<dfn>piped</dfn>) together with `operator|`.
This mechanism is similar to the `operator|` composition that C++ range adaptors support and draws inspiration from piping in *nix shells.
Pipeable sender adaptors take a sender as their first parameter and have no other sender parameters.

`a | b` will pass the sender `a` as the first argument to the pipeable sender adaptor `b`. Pipeable sender adaptors support partial application of the parameters after the first. For example, all of the following are equivalent:

<pre highlight=c++>
execution::bulk(snd, N, [] (std::size_t i, auto d) {});
execution::bulk(N, [] (std::size_t i, auto d) {})(snd);
snd | execution::bulk(N, [] (std::size_t i, auto d) {});
</pre>

Piping enables you to compose together senders with a linear syntax.
Without it, you'd have to use either nested function call syntax, which would cause a syntactic inversion of the direction of control flow, or you'd have to introduce a temporary variable for each stage of the pipeline.
Consider the following example where we want to execute first on a CPU thread pool, then on a CUDA GPU, then back on the CPU thread pool:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Syntax Style
<th>Example
<tr>
<th>Function call <br/> (nested)
<td><pre highlight=c++>
auto snd = execution::then(
             execution::transfer(
               execution::then(
                 execution::transfer(
                   execution::then(
                     execution::schedule(get_thread_pool_scheduler())
                     []{ return 123; }),
                   cuda::new_stream_scheduler()),
                 [](int i){ return 123 * 5; }),
               get_thread_pool()),
             [](int i){ return i - 5; });
auto [result] = this_thread::sync_wait(snd).value();
// result == 610
</pre>

auto snd3 = execution::then(snd2, [](int i){ return 123 * 5; })
auto snd4 = execution::transfer(snd3, get_thread_pool())
auto snd5 = execution::then(snd4, [](int i){ return i - 5; });
auto [result] = *this_thread::sync_wait(snd4);
// result == 610
</pre>
<tr>

<td><pre highlight=c++>
auto snd = execution::schedule(get_thread_pool_scheduler())
         | execution::then([]{ return 123; })
         | execution::transfer(cuda::new_stream_scheduler())
         | execution::then([](int i){ return 123 * 5; })
         | execution::transfer(get_thread_pool())
         | execution::then([](int i){ return i - 5; });
auto [result] = this_thread::sync_wait(snd).value();
// result == 610
</pre>
</table>

Certain sender adaptors are not be pipeable, because using the pipeline syntax can result in confusion of the semantics of the adaptors involved. Specifically, the following sender adaptors are not pipeable.

* `execution::when_all` and `execution::when_all_with_variant`: Since this sender adaptor takes a variadic pack of senders, a partially applied form would be ambiguous with a non partially applied form with an arity of one less.
* `execution::on` and `execution::lazy_on`: This sender adaptor changes how the sender passed to it is executed, not what happens to its result, but allowing it in a pipeline makes it read as if it performed a function more similar to `transfer`.

Sender consumers could be made pipeable, but we have chosen to not do so.
However, since these are terminal nodes in a pipeline and nothing can be piped after them, we believe a pipe syntax may be confusing as well as unnecessary, as consumers cannot be chained.
We believe sender consumers read better with function call syntax.

## User-facing sender factories ## {#design-sender-factories}

A <dfn>sender factory</dfn> is an [=algorithm=] that takes no senders as parameters and returns a sender.

### `execution::schedule` ### {#design-sender-factory-schedule}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto schedule(
    execution::scheduler auto scheduler
);
</pre>

Returns a sender describing the start of a task graph on the provided scheduler. See [[#design-schedulers]].

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::scheduler auto sch1 = get_system_thread_pool().scheduler();

execution::sender auto snd1 = execution::schedule(sch1);
// snd1 describes the creation of a new task on the system thread pool
</pre>

### `execution::just` ### {#design-sender-factory-just}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto just(
    auto ...&& values
);
</pre>

Returns a sender with no [=completion scheduler|completion schedulers=], which [=send|sends=] the provided values. If a provided value is an lvalue reference, a copy is made inside the returned sender and a non-const lvalue reference to the copy is sent. If the provided value is an rvalue reference, it is moved into the returned sender and an rvalue reference to it is sent.

```c++
execution::sender auto snd1 = execution::just(3.14);
execution::sender auto then1 = execution::then(snd1, [] (double d) {
  std::cout << d << "\n";
});

execution::sender auto snd2 = execution::just(3.14, 42);
execution::sender auto then2 = execution::then(snd1, [] (double d, int i) {
  std::cout << d << ", " << i << "\n";
});

std::vector v3{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
execution::sender auto snd3 = execution::just(v3);
execution::sender auto then3 = execution::then(snd3, [] (std::vector<int>& v3copy) {
  for (auto&& e : v3copy) { e *= 2; } return v3copy;
}
auto&& [v3copy] = this_thread::sync_wait(then3).value();
// v3 contains {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; v3copy will contain {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.

execution::sender auto snd4 = execution::just(std::vector{1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
execution::sender auto then4 = execution::then(snd4, [] (std::vector<int>&& v4) {
  for (auto&& e : v4) { e *= 2; }
  return std::move(v4);
});
auto&& [v4] = this_thread::sync_wait(then4).value();
// v4 contains {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.
```

### `execution::transfer_just` ### {#design-sender-factory-transfer_just}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto transfer_just(
    execution::scheduler auto scheduler,
    auto ...&& values
);
</pre>

Returns a sender whose value [=completion scheduler=] is the provided scheduler, which [=send|sends=] the provided values in the same manner as `just`.

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto vals = execution::transfer_just(
    get_system_thread_pool().scheduler(),
    1, 2, 3
);
execution::sender auto snd = execution::then(pred, [](auto... args) {
    std::print(args..);
});
// when snd is executed, it will print "123"
</pre>

This adaptor is included as it greatly simplifies lifting values into senders.

## User-facing sender adaptors ## {#design-sender-adaptors}

A <dfn>sender adaptor</dfn> is an [=algorithm=] that takes one or more senders, which it may `execution::connect`, as parameters, and returns a sender, whose completion is related to the sender arguments it has received.

Many sender adaptors come in two versions: a strictly lazy one, which is never allowed to submit any work for execution prior to the returned sender being <dfn lt="start">started</dfn> later on, and a potentially eager one, which is allowed to submit work prior to
the returned sender being started. Sender consumers such as [[#design-sender-adaptor-ensure_started]], [[#design-sender-consumer-start_detached]], and [[#design-sender-consumer-sync_wait]] start senders; the implementations of non-lazy versions of the sender adaptors are **allowed**,
but not guaranteed, to start senders.

The strictly lazy versions of the adaptors below (that is, all the versions whose names start with `lazy_`) are guaranteed to not start any input senders passed into them.

For more implementer-centric description of starting senders, see [[#design-laziness]].

### `execution::transfer` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-transfer}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto transfer(
    execution::sender auto input,
    execution::scheduler auto scheduler
);

execution::sender auto lazy_transfer(
    execution::sender auto input,
    execution::scheduler auto scheduler
);
</pre>

Returns a sender describing the transition from the execution agent of the input sender to the execution agent of the target scheduler. See [[#design-transitions]].

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::scheduler auto cpu_sched = get_system_thread_pool().scheduler();
execution::scheduler auto gpu_sched = cuda::scheduler();

execution::sender auto cpu_task = execution::schedule(cpu_sched);
// cpu_task describes the creation of a new task on the system thread pool

execution::sender auto gpu_task = execution::transfer(cpu_task, gpu_sched);
// gpu_task describes the transition of the task graph described by cpu_task to the gpu
</pre>

### `execution::then` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-then}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto then(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<<i>values-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);

execution::sender auto lazy_then(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<<i>values-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);
</pre>

`then` returns a sender describing the task graph described by the input sender, with an added node of invoking the provided function with the values [=send|sent=] by the input sender as arguments.

`lazy_then` is **guaranteed** to not begin executing `function` until the returned sender is started.

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto input = get_input();
execution::sender auto snd = execution::then(input, [](auto... args) {
    std::print(args..);
});
// snd describes the work described by pred
// followed by printing all of the values sent by pred
</pre>

This adaptor is included as it is necessary for writing any sender code that actually performs a useful function.

### `execution::upon_*` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-upon}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto upon_error(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<<i>errors-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);

execution::sender auto lazy_upon_error(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<<i>errors-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);

execution::sender auto upon_error(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<> function
);

execution::sender auto lazy_upon_error(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<> function
);
</pre>

`upon_error` and `upon_done` are similar to `then`, but where `then` works with values sent by the input sender, `upon_error` works with errors, and `upon_done` is invoked when the "done" signal is sent.

### `execution::let_*` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-let}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto let_value(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<<i>values-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);

execution::sender auto lazy_let_value(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<<i>values-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);

execution::sender auto let_error(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<<i>errors-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);

execution::sender auto lazy_let_error(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<<i>errors-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);

execution::sender auto let_done(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<> function
);

execution::sender auto lazy_let_done(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable<> function
);
</pre>

`let_value` is very similar to `then`: when it is started, it invokes the provided function with the values [=send|sent=] by the input sender as arguments. However, where the sender returned from `then` sends exactly what that function ends up returning -
`let_value` requires that the function return a sender, and the sender returned by `let_value` sends the values sent by the sender returned from the callback. This is similar to the notion of "future unwrapping" in future/promise-based frameworks.

`lazy_let_value` is **guaranteed** to not begin executing `function` until the returned sender is started.

`let_error` and `let_done` are similar to `let_value`, but where `let_value` works with values sent by the input sender, `let_error` works with errors, and `let_done` is invoked when the "done" signal is sent.

### `execution::on` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-on}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto on(
    execution::scheduler auto sched,
    execution::sender auto snd
);

execution::sender auto lazy_on(
    execution::scheduler auto sched,
    execution::sender auto snd
);
</pre>

Returns a sender which, when started, will start the provided sender on an execution agent belonging to the execution context associated with the provided scheduler. This returned sender has no [=completion scheduler|completion schedulers=].

### `execution::into_variant` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-into_variant}

<pre highlight=c++>
execution::sender into_variant(
    execution::sender auto snd
);
</pre>

Returns a sender which sends a variant of tuples of all the possible sets of types sent by the input sender. Senders can send multiple sets of values depending on runtime conditions; this is a helper function that turns them into a single variant value.

### `execution::bulk` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-bulk}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto bulk(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::integral auto size,
    invocable&lt;decltype(size), <i>values-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);

execution::sender auto lazy_bulk(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::integral auto size,
    invocable&lt;decltype(size), <i>values-sent-by(input)</i>...> function
);
</pre>

Returns a sender describing the task of invoking the provided function with the values [=send|sent=] by the input sender for every index in the provided shape.

In this paper, only integral types satisfy the concept of a shape, but future papers will explore bulk shapes of different kinds in more detail.

`lazy_bulk` is **guaranteed** to not begin executing `function` until the returned sender is started.

### `execution::split` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-split}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto split(execution::sender auto sender);

execution::sender auto lazy_split(execution::sender auto sender);
</pre>

If the provided sender is a multi-shot sender, returns that sender. Otherwise, returns a multi-shot sender which sends values equivalent to the values sent by the provided sender. See [[#design-shot]].

### `execution::when_all` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-when_all}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto when_all(
    execution::sender auto ...inputs
);

execution::sender auto when_all_with_variant(
    execution::sender auto ...inputs
);
</pre>

`when_all` returns a sender which completes once all of the input senders have completed. The values send by this sender are the values sent by each of the input, in order of the arguments passed to `when_all`.

`when_all_with_variant` does the same, but it adapts all the input senders using `into_variant`.

The returned sender has no [=completion scheduler|completion schedulers=].

`when_all` is a strictly lazy adaptor.
It is guaranteed to not start any of the input senders until the returned sender is started.

See [[#design-join]].

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::scheduler auto sched = get_thread_pool().scheduler();

execution::sender auto sends_1 = ...;
execution::sender auto sends_abc = ...;

execution::sender auto both = execution::when_all(sched,
    sends_1,
    sends_abc
);

execution::sender auto final = execution::then(both, [](auto... args){
    std::cout << std::format("the two args: {}, {}", args...);
});
// when final executes, it will print "the two args: 1, abc"
</pre>

### `execution::transfer_when_all` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-transfer_when_all}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto transfer_when_all(
    execution::scheduler auto sched,
    execution::sender auto ...inputs
);

execution::sender auto transfer_when_all_with_variant(
    execution::scheduler auto sched,
    execution::sender auto ...inputs
);

execution::sender auto lazy_transfer_when_all(
    execution::scheduler auto sched,
    execution::sender auto ...inputs
);

execution::sender auto lazy_transfer_when_all_with_variant(
    execution::scheduler auto sched,
    execution::sender auto ...inputs
);
</pre>

Similar to [[#design-sender-adaptor-when_all]], but returns a sender whose value [=completion scheduler=] is the provided scheduler.

See [[#design-join]].

### `execution::ensure_started` ### {#design-sender-adaptor-ensure_started}

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto ensure_started(
    execution::sender auto sender
);
</pre>

Once `ensure_started` returns, it is known that the provided sender has been [=connect|connected=] and `start` has been called on the resulting operation state (see [[#design-states]]); in other words, the work described by the provided sender has been submitted
for execution on the appropriate execution contexts. Returns a sender which completes when the provided sender completes and sends values equivalent to those of the provided sender.

## User-facing sender consumers ## {#design-sender-consumers}

A <dfn>sender consumer</dfn> is an [=algorithm=] that takes one or more senders, which it may `execution::connect`, as parameters, and does not return a sender.

### `execution::start_detached` ### {#design-sender-consumer-start_detached}

<pre highlight="c++">
void auto start_detached(
    execution::sender auto sender
);
</pre>

Like `ensure_started`, but does not return a value; if the provided sender sends an error instead of a value, `std::terminate` is called.

### `this_thread::sync_wait` ### {#design-sender-consumer-sync_wait}

<pre highlight="c++">
auto sync_wait(
    execution::sender auto sender
) requires (<i>always-sends-same-values</i>(sender))
    -> std::optional&lt;std::tuple&lt;<i>values-sent-by</i>(sender)>>;
</pre>

`this_thread::sync_wait` is a sender consumer that submits the work described by the provided sender for execution, similarly to `ensure_started`, except that it blocks <b>the current `std::thread` or thread of `main`</b> until the work is completed, and returns
an optional tuple of values that were sent by the provided sender on its completion of work. Where [[#design-sender-factory-schedule]] and [[#design-sender-factory-transfer_just]] are meant to <i>enter</i> the domain of senders, `sync_wait` is meant to <i>exit</i> the domain of
senders, retrieving the result of the task graph.

If the provided sender sends an error instead of values, `sync_wait` throws that error as an exception, or rethrows the original exception if the error is of type `std::exception_ptr`.

If the provided sender sends the "done" signal instead of values, `sync_wait` returns an empty optional.

For an explanation of the `requires` clause, see [[#design-typed]]. That clause also explains another sender consumer, built on top of `sync_wait`: `sync_wait_with_variant`.

Note: This function is specified inside `std::this_thread`, and not inside `execution`. This is because `sync_wait` has to block the <i>current</i> execution agent, but determining what the current execution agent is is not reliable. Since the standard
does not specify any functions on the current execution agent other than those in `std::this_thread`, this is the flavor of this function that is being proposed. If C++ ever obtains fibers, for instance, we expect that a variant of this function called
`std::this_fiber::sync_wait` would be provided. We also expect that runtimes with execution agents that use different synchronization mechanisms than `std::thread`'s will provide their own flavors of `sync_wait` as well (assuming their execution agents have the means
to block in a non-deadlock manner).

## `execution::execute` ## {#design-execute}

In addition to the three categories of functions presented above, we also propose to include a convenience function for fire-and-forget eager one-way submission of an invocable to a scheduler, to fulfil the role of one-way executors from P0443.

<pre highlight="c++">
void execution::execute(
    execution::schedule auto sched,
    std::invocable<void> auto fn
);
</pre>

Submits the provided function for execution on the provided scheduler, as-if by:

<pre highlight="c++">
auto snd = execution::schedule(sched);
auto work = execution::then(snd, fn);
execution::start_detached(work);
</pre>

# Design - implementer side # {#design-implementer}

## Receivers serve as glue between senders ## {#design-receivers}

A <dfn>receiver</dfn> is a callback that supports more than one channel. In fact, it supports three of them:

* `set_value`, which is the moral equivalent of an `operator()` or a function call, which signals successful completion of the operation its execution depends on;
* `set_error`, which signals that an error has happened during scheduling of the current work, executing the current work, or at some earlier point in the sender chain; and
* `set_done`, which signals that the operation completed without succeeding (`set_value`) and without failing (`set_error`). This result is often used to indicate that the operation stopped early, typically because it was asked to do so because the result is no
    longer needed.

Exactly one of these channels must be successfully (i.e. without an exception being thrown) invoked on a receiver before it is destroyed; if a call to `set_value` failed with an exception, either `set_error` or `set_done` must be invoked on the same receiver. These
requirements are know as the <dfn>receiver contract</dfn>.

While the receiver interface may look novel, it is in fact very similar to the interface of `std::promise`, which provides the first two signals as `set_value` and `set_error`, and it's possible to emulate the third channel with lifetime management of the promise.

Receivers are not a part of the end-user-facing API of this proposal; they are necessary to allow unrelated senders communicate with each other, but the only users who will interact with receivers directly are authors of senders.

Receivers are what is passed as the second argument to [[#design-connect]].

## Operation states represent work ## {#design-states}

An <dfn>operation state</dfn> is an object that represents work. Unlike senders, it is not a chaining mechanism; instead, it is a concrete object that packages the work described by a full sender chain, ready to be executed. An operation state is neither movable nor
copyable, and its interface consists of a single algorithm: `start`, which serves as the submission point of the work represented by a given operation state.

Operation states are not a part of the user-facing API of this proposal; they are necessary for implementing sender consumers like `execution::ensure_started` and `this_thread::sync_wait`, and the knowledge of them is necessary to implement senders, so the only users who will
interact with operation states directly are authors of senders and authors of sender algorithms.

The return value of [[#design-connect]] must satisfy the operation state concept.

## `execution::connect` ## {#design-connect}

`execution::connect` is a customization point which <dfn lt="connect">connects</dfn> senders with receivers, resulting in an operation state that will ensure that the [=receiver contract=] of the receiver passed to `connect` will be fulfilled.

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::sender auto snd = <i>some input sender</i>;
execution::receiver auto rcv = <i>some receiver</i>;
execution::operation_state auto state = execution::connect(snd, rcv);

execution::start(state);
// at this point, it is guaranteed that the work represented by state has been submitted
// to an execution context, and that execution context will eventually fulfill the
// receiver contract of rcv

// operation states are not movable, and therefore this operation state object must be
// kept alive until the operation finishes
</pre>

## Sender algorithms are customizable ## {#design-customization}

Senders being able to advertise what their [=completion schedulers=] are fulfills one of the promises of senders: that of being able to customize an implementation of a sender algorithm based on what scheduler any work it depends on will complete on.

The simple way to provide customizations for functions like `then`, that is for [=sender adaptors=] and [=sender consumers=], is to follow the customization scheme that has been adopted for C++20 ranges library; to do that, we would define
the expression `execution::then(sender, invocable)` to be equivalent to:

  1. `sender.then(invocable)`, if that expression is well formed; otherwise
  2. `then(sender, invocable)`, performed in a context where this call always performs ADL, if that expression is well formed; otherwise
  3. a default implementation of `then`, which returns a sender adaptor, and then define the exact semantics of said adaptor.

However, this definition is problematic. Imagine another sender adaptor, `bulk`, which is a structured abstraction for a loop over an index space. Its default implementation is just a for loop. However, for accelerator runtimes like CUDA, we would like sender algorithms
like `bulk` to have specialized behavior, which invokes a kernel of more than one thread (with its size defined by the call to `bulk`); therefore, we would like to customize `bulk` for CUDA senders to achieve this. However, there's no reason for CUDA kernels to
necessarily customize the `then` sender adaptor, as the generic implementation is perfectly sufficient. This creates a problem, though; consider the following snippet:

<pre highlight="c++">
execution::scheduler auto cuda_sch = cuda_scheduler{};

execution::sender auto initial = execution::schedule(cuda_sch);
// the type of initial is a type defined by the cuda_scheduler
// let's call it cuda::schedule_sender&lt;>

execution::sender auto next = execution::then(cuda_sch, []{ return 1; });
// the type of next is a standard-library implementation-defined sender adaptor
// that wraps the cuda sender
// let's call it execution::then_sender_adaptor&lt;cuda::schedule_sender&lt;>>

execution::sender auto kernel_sender = execution::bulk(next, shape, [](int i){ ... });
</pre>

How can we specialize the `bulk` sender adaptor for our wrapped `schedule_sender`? Well, here's one possible approach, taking advantage of ADL (and the fact that the definition of "associated namespace" also recursively enumerates the associated namespaces of all template
parameters of a type):

<pre highlight="c++">
namespace cuda::for_adl_purposes {
template&lt;typename... SentValues>
class schedule_sender {
    execution::operation_state auto connect(execution::receiver auto rcv);
    execution::scheduler auto get_completion_scheduler() const;
};

execution::sender auto bulk(
    execution::sender auto && input,
    execution::shape auto && shape,
    invocable<<i>sender-values(input)</i>> auto && fn)
{
    // return a cuda sender representing a bulk kernel launch
}
} // namespace cuda::for_adl_purposes
</pre>

However, if the input sender is not just a `then_sender_adaptor` like in the example above, but another sender that overrides `bulk` by itself, as a member function, because its author believes they know an optimization for bulk - the specialization above will no
longer be selected, because a member function of the first argument is a better match than the ADL-found overload.

This means that well-meant specialization of sender algorithms that are entirely scheduler-agnostic can have negative consequences.
The scheduler-specific specialization - which is essential for good performance on platforms providing specialized ways to launch certain sender algorithms - would not be selected in such cases.
But it's really the scheduler that should control the behavior of sender algorithms when a non-default implementation exists, not the sender. Senders merely describe work; schedulers, however, are the handle to the
runtime that will eventually execute said work, and should thus have the final say in *how* the work is going to be executed.

Therefore, we are proposing the following customization scheme (also modified to take [[#design-dispatch]] into account): the expression `execution::<sender-algorithm>(sender, args...)`, for any given sender algorithm that accepts a sender as its first argument, should be
equivalent to:

  1. <code>tag_invoke(&lt;sender-algorithm>, get_completion_scheduler&lt;<i>Signal</i>>(sender), sender, args...)</code>, if that expression is well-formed; otherwise
  2. `tag_invoke(<sender-algorithm>, sender, args...)`, if that expression is well-formed; otherwise
  4. a default implementation, if there exists a default implementation of the given sender algorithm.

where <code><i>Signal</i></code> is one of `set_value`, `set_error`, or `set_done`; for most sender algorithms, the completion scheduler for `set_value` would be used, but for some (like `upon_error` or `let_done`), one of the others would be used.

For sender algorithms which accept concepts other than `sender` as their first argument, we propose that the customization scheme remains as it has been in [[P0443R14]] so far, except it should also use `tag_invoke`.

## Laziness is defined by sender adaptors ## {#design-laziness}

We distinguish two different guarantees about *when* work is submitted to an execution context:

 * <dfn>strictly lazy submission</dfn>, which means that there is a guarantee that no work is submitted to an execution context before a receiver is connected to a sender, and `execution::start` is called on the resulting operation state;
 * <dfn>potentially eager submission</dfn>, which means that work may be submitted to an execution context as soon as all the information necessary to perform it is provided.

If a sender adaptor requires potentially eager submission, strictly lazy submission is acceptable as an implementation, because it does fulfill the potentially eager guarantee. This is why the default implementations for the non-strictly-lazy sender adaptors are specified
to dispatch to the strictly lazy ones; for an author of a specific sender, it is sufficient to specialize the strictly lazy version, to also achieve a specialization of the potentially eager one.

As has been described in [[#design-sender-adaptors]], whether a sender adaptor is guaranteed to perform strictly lazy submission or not is defined by the adaptor used to perform it; the adaptors whose names begin with `lazy_` provide the strictly lazy guarantee.

## Lazy senders provide optimization opportunities ## {#design-fusion}

Because lazy senders fundamentally *describe* work, instead of describing or representing the submission of said work to an execution context, and thanks to the flexibility of the customization of most sender algorithms, they provide an opportunity for fusing
multiple algorithms in a sender chain together, into a single function that can later be submitted for execution by an execution context. There are two ways this can happen.

The first (and most common) way for such optimizations to happen is thanks to the structure of the implementation: because all the work is done within callbacks invoked on the completion of an earlier sender, recursively up to the original source of computation,
the compiler is able to see a chain of work described using senders as a tree of tail calls, allowing for inlining and removal of most of the sender machinery. In fact, when work is not submitted to execution contexts outside of the current thread of execution,
compilers are capable of removing the senders abstraction entirely, while still allowing for composition of functions across different parts of a program.

The second way for this to occur is when a sender algorithm is specialized for a specific set of arguments. For instance, we expect that, for senders which are known to have been started already, [[#design-sender-adaptor-ensure_started]] will be an identity transformation,
because the sender algorithm will be specialized for such senders. Similarly, an implementation could recognize two subsequent lazy [[#design-sender-adaptor-bulk]]s of compatible shapes, and merge them together into a single submission of a GPU kernel.

## Execution context transitions are two-step ## {#design-transition-details}

Because `execution::transfer` takes a sender as its first argument, it is not actually directly customizable by the target scheduler. This is by design: the target scheduler may not know how to transition <i>from</i> a scheduler such as a CUDA scheduler;
transitioning away from a GPU in an efficient manner requires making runtime calls that are specific to the GPU in question, and the same is usually true for other kinds of accelerators too (or for scheduler running on remote systems). To avoid this problem,
specialized schedulers like the ones mentioned here can still hook into the transition mechanism, and inject a sender which will perform a transition to the regular CPU execution context, so that any sender can be attached to it.

This, however, is a problem: because customization of sender algorithms must be controlled by the scheduler they will run on (see [[#design-customization]]), the type of the sender returned from `transfer` must be controllable by the target scheduler. Besides, the target
scheduler may itself represent a specialized execution context, which requires additional work to be performed to transition <i>to</i> it. GPUs and remote node schedulers are once again good examples of such schedulers: executing code on their execution contexts
requires making runtime API calls for work submission, and quite possibly for the data movement of the values being sent by the input sender passed into `transfer`.

To allow for such customization from both ends, we propose the inclusion of a secondary transitioning sender adaptor, called `schedule_from`. This adaptor is a form of `schedule`, but takes an additional, second argument: the input sender. This adaptor is not
meant to be invoked manually by the end users; they are always supposed to invoke `transfer`, to ensure that both schedulers have a say in how the transitions are made. Any scheduler that specializes `transfer(snd, sch)` shall ensure that the
return value of their customization is equivalent to `schedule_from(sch, snd2)`, where `snd2` is a successor of `snd` that sends values equivalent to those sent by `snd`.

The default implementation of `transfer(snd, sched)` is `schedule_from(sched, snd)`.

## Most senders are typed ## {#design-typed}

All senders should advertise the types they will [=send=] when they complete. This is necessary for a number of features, and writing code in a way that's agnostic of whether an imput sender is typed or not in common sender adaptors such as `execution::then` is
hard.

The mechanism for this advertisement is the same as in [[P0443R14]]; the way to query the types is through `sender_traits::value_types<tuple_like, variant_like>`.

`sender_traits::value_types` is a template that takes two arguments: one is a tuple-like template, the other is a variant-like template. The tuple-like argument is required to represent senders sending more than one value (such as `when_all`). The variant-like
argument is required to represent senders that choose which specific values to send at runtime.

There's a choice made in the specification of [[#design-sender-consumer-sync_wait]]: it returns a tuple of values sent by the sender passed to it, wrapped in `std::optional` to handle the `set_done` signal. However, this assumes that those values can be represented as a
tuple, like here:

<pre highlight=c++>
execution::sender auto sends_1 = ...;
execution::sender auto sends_2 = ...;
execution::sender auto sends_3 = ...;

auto [a, b, c] = this_thread::sync_wait(
    execution::transfer_when_all(
        execution::get_completion_scheduler&lt;execution::set_value_t>(sends_1),
        sends_1,
        sends_2,
        sends_3
    )).value();
// a == 1
// b == 2
// c == 3
</pre>

This works well for senders that always send the same set of arguments. If we ignore the possibility of having a sender that sends different sets of arguments into a receiver, we can specify the "canonical" (i.e. required to be followed by all senders) form of
`value_types` of a sender which sends `Types...` to be as follows:

<pre highlight=c++>
template&lt;template&lt;typename ...> typename TupleLike>
using value_types = TupleLike<Types...>;
</pre>

If senders could only ever send one specific set of values, this would probably need to be the required form of `value_types` for all senders; defining it otherwise would cause very weird results and should be considered a bug.

This matter is somewhat complicated by the fact that (1) `set_value` for receivers can be overloaded and accept different sets of arguments, and (2) senders are allowed to send multiple different sets of values, depending on runtime conditions, the data they
consumed, and so on. To accomodate this, [[P0443R14]] also includes a second template parameter to `value_types`, one that represents a variant-like type. If we permit such senders, we would almost certainly need to require that the canonical form of `value_types`
for *all* senders (to ensure consistency in how they are handled, and to avoid accidentally interpreting a user-provided variant as a sender-provided one) sending the different sets of arguments `Types1...`, `Types2...`, ..., `TypesN...` to be as follows:

<pre highlight=c++>
template&lt;
    template&lt;typename ...> typename TupleLike,
    template&lt;typename ...> typename VariantLike
>
using value_types = VariantLike&lt;
    TupleLike&lt;Types1...>,
    TupleLike&lt;Types2...>,
    ...,
    TupleLike&lt;Types3...>
>;
</pre>

This, however, introduces a couple of complications:

1. A `just(1)` sender would also need to follow this structure, so the correct type for storing the value sent by it would be `std::variant<std::tuple<int>>` or some such. This introduces a lot of compile time overhead for the simplest senders, and this overhead
    effectively exists in all places in the code where `value_types` is queried, regardless of the tuple-like and variant-like templates passed to it. Such overhead does exist if only the tuple-like parameter exists, but is made much worse by adding this second
    wrapping layer.
2. As a consequence of (1): because `sync_wait` needs to store the above type, it can no longer return just a `std::tuple<int>` for `just(1)`; it has to return `std::variant<std::tuple<int>>`. C++ currently does not have an easy way to destructure this; it may get
    less awkward with pattern matching, but even then it seems extremely heavyweight to involve variants in this API, and for the purpose of generic code, the kind of the return type of `sync_wait` must be the same across all sender types.

One possible solution to (2) above is to place a requirement on `sync_wait` that it can only accept senders which send only a single set of values, therefore removing the need for `std::variant` to appear in its API; because of this, we propose to expose both
`sync_wait`, which is a simple, user-friendly version of the sender consumer, but requires that `value_types` have only one possible variant, and `sync_wait_with_variant`, which accepts any sender, but returns an optional whose value type is the variant of all the
possible tuples sent by the input sender:

<pre highlight=c++>
auto sync_wait_with_variant(
    execution::sender auto sender
) -> std::optional&lt;std::variant&lt;
        std::tuple&lt;<i>values<sub>0</sub>-sent-by</i>(sender)>,
        std::tuple&lt;<i>values<sub>1</sub>-sent-by</i>(sender)>,
        ...,
        std::tuple&lt;<i>values<sub>n</sub>-sent-by</i>(sender)>
    >>;

auto sync_wait(
    execution::sender auto sender
) requires (<i>always-sends-same-values</i>(sender))
    -> std::optional&lt;std::tuple&lt;<i>values-sent-by</i>(sender)>>;
</pre>

## Ranges-style CPOs vs `tag_invoke` ## {#design-dispatch}

The contemporary technique for customization in the Standard Library is customization point objects. A customization point object, will it look for member functions and then for nonmember functions with the same name as the customization point, and calls those if
they match. This is the technique used by the C++20 ranges library, and previous executors proposals ([[P0443R14]] and [[P1897R3]]) intended to use it as well. However, it has several unfortunate consequences:

1. It does not allow for easy propagation of customization points unknown to the adaptor to a wrapped object, which makes writing universal adapter types much harder - and this proposal uses quite a lot of those.

2. It effectively reserves names globally. Because neither member names nor ADL-found functions can be qualified with a namespace, every customization point object that uses the ranges scheme reserves the name for all types in all namespaces. This is unfortunate
    due to the sheer number of customization points already in the paper, but also ones that we are envisioning in the future. It's also a big problem for one of the operations being proposed already: `sync_wait`. We imagine that if, in the future, C++ was to
    gain fibers support, we would want to also have `std::this_fiber::sync_wait`, in addition to `std::this_thread::sync_wait`. However, because we would want the names to be the same in both cases, we would need to make the names of the customizations not match the
    names of the customization points. This is undesirable.

This paper proposes to instead use the mechanism described in [[P1895R0]]: `tag_invoke`; the wording for `tag_invoke` has been incorporated into the proposed specification in this paper.

In short, instead of using globally reserved names, `tag_invoke` uses the <i>type</i> of the customization point object itself as the mechanism to find customizations. It globally reserves only a single name - `tag_invoke` - which itself is used the same way that
ranges-style customization points are used. All other customization points are defined in terms of `tag_invoke`. For example, the customization for `std::this_thread::sync_wait(s)` will call `tag_invoke(std::this_thread::sync_wait, s)`, instead of attempting
to invoke `s.sync_wait()`, and then `sync_wait(s)` if the member call is not valid.

Using `tag_invoke` has the following benefits:

1. It reserves only a single global name, instead of reserving a global name for every customization point object we define.

2. It is possible to propagate customizations to a subobject, because the information of which customization point is being resolved is in the type of an argument, and not in the name of the function:

    <pre highlight=c++>
    // forward most customizations to a subobject
    template&lt;typename Tag, typename ...Args>
    friend auto tag_invoke(Tag && tag, wrapper & self, Args &&... args) {
        return std::forward&lt;Tag>(tag)(self.subobject, std::forward&lt;Args>(args)...);
    }

    // but override one of them with a specific value
    friend auto tag_invoke(specific_customization_point_t, wrapper & self) {
        return self.some_value;
    }
    </pre>

3. It is possible to pass those as template arguments to types, because the information of which customization point is being resolved is in the type. Similarly to how [[P0443R14]] defines a polymorphic executor wrapper which accepts a list of properties it
    supports, we can imagine scheduler and sender wrappers that accept a list of queries and operations they support. That list can contain the types of the customization point objects, and the polymorphic wrappers can then specialize those customization points on
    themselves using `tag_invoke`, dispatching to manually constructed vtables containing pointers to specialized implementations for the wrapped objects. For an example of such a polymorphic wrapper, see
    <code>[unifex::any_unique](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex/blob/1a6fbfc9cc3829356ccbdcf9e8d1f3cc33a6d9e0/include/unifex/any_unique.hpp)</code>
    ([example](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/libunifex/blob/1a6fbfc9cc3829356ccbdcf9e8d1f3cc33a6d9e0/examples/any_unique.cpp)).

### Stop token concepts <b>[thread.stoptoken.concepts]</b> ### {#spec-thread.stoptoken.concepts}

Insert this section as a new subclause between Header `<stop_token>` synopsis <b>[thread.stoptoken.syn]</b> and Class `stop_token` <b>[stoptoken]</b>.

<ins>
<blockquote>
1. The `stoppable_token` concept checks for the basic interface of a “stop token” which is copyable and allows polling to see if stop has been requested and also whether a stop request is possible. It also requires an associated nested template-type-alias,
    `T::callback_type<CB>`, that identifies the stop-callback type to use to register a callback to be executed if a stop-request is ever made on a stoppable_token of type, `T`. The `stoppable_token_for` concept checks for a stop token type compatible with a given
    callback type. The `unstoppable_token` concept checks for a stop token type that does not allow stopping.

<pre>
template&lt;typename T>
  concept stoppable_token =
    copy_constructible&lt;T> &&
    move_constructible&lt;T> &&
    is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v&lt;T> &&
    is_nothrow_move_constructible_v&lt;T> &&
    equality_comparable&lt;T> &&
    requires (const T& token) {
      { token.stop_requested() } noexcept -> boolean-testable;
      { token.stop_possible() } noexcept -> boolean-testable;
      typename <i>check-type-alias-exists</i>&lt;T::template callback_type>;
    };

template&lt;typename T, typename CB, typename Initializer = CB>
  concept stoppable_token_for =
    stoppable_token&lt;T> &&
    invocable&lt;CB> &&
    requires {
      typename T::template callback_type&lt;CB>;
    } &&
    constructible_from&lt;CB, Initializer> &&
    constructible_from&lt;typename T::template callback_type&lt;CB>, T, Initializer> &&
    constructible_from&lt;typename T::template callback_type&lt;CB>, T&, Initializer> &&
    constructible_from&lt;typename T::template callback_type&lt;CB>, const T, Initializer> &&
    constructible_from&lt;typename T::template callback_type&lt;CB>, const T&, Initializer>;

template&lt;typename T>
  concept unstoppable_token =
    stoppable_token&lt;T> &&
    requires {
      { T::stop_possible() } -> boolean-testable;
    } &&
    (!T::stop_possible());
</pre>

2. Let `t` and `u` be distinct object of type `T`. The type `T` models `stoppable_token` only if:

    1. All copies of a `stoppable_token` reference the same logical shared stop state and shall report values consistent with each other.

    2. If `t.stop_possible()` evaluates to `false` then, if `u`, references the same logical shared stop state, `u.stop_possible()` shall also subsequently evaluate to `false` and `u.stop_requested()` shall also subsequently evaluate to `false`.

    3. If `t.stop_requested()` evaluates to `true` then, if `u`, references the same logical shared stop state, `u.stop_requested()` shall also subsequently evaluate to `true` and `u.stop_possible()` shall also subsequently evaluate to `true`.

    4. Given a callback-type, CB, and a callback-initializer argument, `init`, of type `Initializer` then constructing an instance, `cb`, of type `T::callback_type<CB>`, passing `t` as the first argument and `init` as the second argument to the constructor, shall,
        if `t.stop_possible()` is `true`, construct an instance, `callback`, of type `CB`, direct-initialized with `init`, and register callback with `t`’s shared stop state such that callback will be invoked with an empty argument list if a stop request is made on
        the shared stop state.

        1. If `t.stop_requested()` is `true` at the time callback is registered then callback may be invoked immediately inline inside the call to `cb`’s constructor.

        2. If callback is invoked then, if `u` references the same shared stop state as `t`, an evaluation of `u.stop_requested()` will be `true` if the beginning of the invocation of callback strongly-happens-before the evaluation of `u.stop_requested()`.

        3. If `t.stop_possible()` evaluates to `false` then the construction of `cb` is not required to construct and initialize `callback`.

    5. Construction of a `T::callback_type<CB>` instance shall only throw exceptions thrown by the initialization of the `CB` instance from the value of type `Initializer`.

    6. Destruction of the `T::callback_type<CB>` object, `cb`, removes `callback` from the shared stop state such that `callback` will not be invoked after the destructor returns.

        1. If `callback` is currently being invoked on another thread then the destructor of `cb` will block until the invocation of `callback` returns such that the return from the invocation of `callback` strongly-happens-before the destruction of `callback`.

        2. Destruction of a callback `cb` shall not block on the completion of the invocation of some other callback registered with the same shared stop state.

      constructible_from&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;T>, T>;
    </pre>

## Schedulers <b>[execution.schedulers] </b> ## {#spec-execution.schedulers}

1. The `scheduler` concept defines the requirements of a type that allows for scheduling of work on its <i>associated execution context</i>.

    <pre highlight=c++>
    template&lt;class S>
      concept scheduler =
        copy_constructible&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S>> &&
        equality_comparable&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S>> &&
        requires(S&& s) {
          execution::schedule((S&&)s);
        };
    </pre>

2. None of a scheduler's copy constructor, destructor, equality comparison, or `swap` member functions shall exit via an exception.

3. None of these member functions, nor a scheduler type's `schedule` function, shall introduce data races as a result of concurrent invocations of those functions from different
    threads.

4. For any two (possibly const) values `s1` and `s2` of some scheduler type `S`, `s1 == s2` shall return `true` only if both `s1` and `s2` are handles to the same associated execution context.

5. A scheduler type's destructor shall not block pending completion of any receivers connected to the sender objects returned from `schedule`. [<i>Note:</i> The ability to wait for completion of submitted function objects may be provided by the associated execution
    context of the scheduler. <i>—end note</i>]

### Scheduler queries <b>[execution.schedulers.queries]</b> ### {#spec-execution.schedulers.queries}

#### `execution::get_forward_progress_guarantee` <b>[execution.schedulers.queries.get_forward_progress_guarantee]</b> #### {#spec-execution.schedulers.queries.get_forward_progress_guarantee}

<pre highlight=c++>
enum class forward_progress_guarantee {
    concurrent,
    parallel,
    weakly_parallel
};
</pre>

1. `execution::get_forward_progress_guarantee` is used to ask a scheduler about the forward progress guarantees of execution agents created by that scheduler.

2. The name `execution::get_forward_progress_guarantee` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpression `s`, let `S` be `decltype((s))`. If `S` does not satisfy `execution::scheduler`, `execution::get_forward_progress_guarantee` is ill-formed.
    Otherwise, `execution::get_forward_progress_guarantee(s)` is expression equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::get_forward_progress_guarantee, as_const(s))`, if this expression is well formed and its type is `execution::forward_progress_guarantee`, and is `noexcept`.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::forward_progress_guarantee::weakly_parallel`.

3. If `execution::get_forward_progress_guarantee(s)` for some scheduler `s` returns `execution::forward_progress_guarantee::concurrent`, all execution agents created by that scheduler shall provide the concurrent forward progress guarantee. If it returns
    `execution::forward_progress_guarantee::parallel`, all execution agents created by that scheduler shall provide at least the parallel forward progress guarantee.

#### `this_thread::execute_may_block_caller` <b>[execution.schedulers.queries.execute_may_block_caller</b> #### {#spec-execution.schedulers.queries.execute_may_block_caller}

1. `this_thread::execute_may_block_caller` is used to ask a scheduler `s` whether a call `execution::execute(s, f)` with any invocable `f` may block the thread where such a call occurs.

2. The name `this_thread::execute_may_block_caller` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpression `s`, let `S` be `decltype((s))`. If `S` does not satisfy `execution::scheduler`, `this_thread::execute_may_block_caller` is ill-formed. Otherwise,
    `this_thread::execute_may_block_caller(s)` is expression equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(this_thread::execute_may_block_caller, as_const(s))`, if this expression is well formed and its type is `bool`, and is `noexcept`.

    2. Otherwise, `true`.

3. If `this_thread::execute_may_block_caller(s)` for some scheduler `s` returns `false`, no `execution::execute(s, f)` call with some invocable `f` shall block the calling thread.

## Receivers <b>[execution.receivers]</b> ## {#spec-execution.receivers}

1. A <i>receiver</i> represents the continuation of an asynchronous operation. An asynchronous operation may complete with a (possibly empty) set of values, an error, or it may be cancelled. A receiver has three principal operations corresponding to the three ways
    an asynchronous operation may complete: `set_value`, `set_error`, and `set_done`. These are collectively known as a receiver’s <i>completion-signal operations</i>.

2. The `receiver` concept defines the requirements for a receiver type with an unknown set of value types. The `receiver_of` concept defines the requirements for a receiver type with a known set of value types, whose error type is `std::exception_ptr`.

    <pre highlight=c++>
    template&lt;class T, class E = exception_ptr>
    concept receiver =
      move_constructible&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;T>> &&
      constructible_from&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;T>, T> &&
      requires(remove_cvref_t&lt;T>&& t, E&& e) {
        { execution::set_done(std::move(t)) } noexcept;
        { execution::set_error(std::move(t), (E&&) e) } noexcept;
      };

    template&lt;class T, class... An>
    concept receiver_of =
      receiver&lt;T> &&
      requires(remove_cvref_t&lt;T>&& t, An&&... an) {
        execution::set_value(std::move(t), (An&&) an...);
      };
    </pre>

3. The receiver’s completion-signal operations have semantic requirements that are collectively known as the <i>receiver contract</i>, described below:

    1. None of a receiver’s completion-signal operations shall be invoked before `execution::start` has been called on the operation state object that was returned by `execution::connect` to connect that receiver to a sender.

    2. Once `execution::start` has been called on the operation state object, exactly one of the receiver’s completion-signal operations shall complete non-exceptionally before the receiver is destroyed.

    3. If `execution::set_value` exits with an exception, it is still valid to call `execution::set_error` or `execution::set_done` on the receiver, but it is no longer valid to call `execution::set_value` on the receiver.

4. Once one of a receiver’s completion-signal operations has completed non-exceptionally, the receiver contract has been satisfied.

### `execution::set_value` <b>[execution.receivers.set_value]</b> ### {#spec-execution.receivers.set_value}

1. `execution::set_value` is used to send a <i>value completion signal</i> to a receiver.

2. The name `execution::set_value` denotes a customization point object. The expression `execution::set_value(R, Vs...)` for some subexpressions `R` and `Vs...` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::set_value, R, Vs...)`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected by `tag_invoke` does not send the value(s) `Vs...` to the receiver `R`’s value channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::set_value(R, Vs...)` is ill-formed.

### `execution::set_error` <b>[execution.receivers.set_error]</b> ### {#spec-execution.receivers.set_error}

1. `execution::set_error` is used to send a <i>error signal</i> to a receiver.

2. The name `execution::set_error` denotes a customization point object. The expression `execution::set_error(R, E)` for some subexpressions `R` and `E` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::set_error, R, E)`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected by `tag_invoke` does not send the error `E` to the receiver `R`’s error channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::set_error(R, E)` is ill-formed.

### `execution::set_done` <b>[execution.receivers.set_done]</b> ### {#spec-execution.receivers.set_done}

1. `execution::set_done` is used to send a <i>done signal</i> to a receiver.

2. The name `execution::set_done` denotes a customization point object. The expression `execution::set_done(R)` for some subexpression `R` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::set_done, R)`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected by `tag_invoke` does not signal the receiver `R`’s done channel, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::set_done(R)` is ill-formed.

### Receiver queries <b>[execution.receivers.queries]</b> ### {#spec-execution.receivers.queries}

#### `execution::get_scheduler` <b>[execution.receivers.queries.get_scheduler]</b> #### {#spec-execution.receivers.queries.get_scheduler}

1. `execution::get_scheduler` is used to ask a receiver object for a <i>suggested scheduler</i> to be used by a sender it is connected to when it needs to launch additional work. [<i>Note:</i> the presence of this query on a receiver does not bind a sender to use
    its result. --<i>end note</i>]

2. The name `execution::get_scheduler` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpression `r`, let `R` be `decltype((r))`. If `R` does not satisfy `execution::receiver`, `execution::get_scheduler` is ill-formed. Otherwise, `execution::get_scheduler(r)` is
    expression equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::get_scheduler, as_const(r))`, if this expression is well formed and satisfies `execution::scheduler`, and is `noexcept`.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::get_scheduler(r)` is ill-formed.

#### `execution::get_allocator` <b>[execution.receivers.queries.get_allocator]</b> #### {#spec-execution.receivers.queries.get_allocator}

1. `execution::get_allocator` is used to ask a receiver object for a <i>suggested allocator</i> to be used by a sender it is connected to when it needs to allocate memory. [<i>Note:</i> the presence of this query on a receiver does not bind a sender to use
    its result. --<i>end note</i>]

2. The name `execution::get_allocator` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpression `r`, let `R` be `decltype((r))`. If `R` does not satisfy `execution::receiver`, `execution::get_allocator` is ill-formed. Otherwise, `execution::get_allocator(r)` is
    expression equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::get_allocator, as_const(r))`, if this expression is well formed and models <i>Allocator</i>, and is `noexcept`.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::get_allocator(r)` is ill-formed.

#### `execution::get_stop_token` <b>[execution.receivers.queries.get_stop_token]</b> #### {#spec-execution.receivers.queries.get_stop_token}

1. `execution::get_stop_token` is used to ask a receiver object for an <i>associated stop token</i> of that receiver. A sender connected with that receiver can use this stop token to check whether a stop request has been made. [<i>Note</i>: such
    a stop token being signalled does not bind the sender to actually cancel any work. --<i>end note</i>]

2. The name `execution::get_stop_token` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpression `r`, let `R` be `decltype((r))`. If `R` does not satisfy `execution::receiver`, `execution::get_stop_token` is ill-formed. Otherwise, `execution::get_stop_token(r)`
    is expression equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::get_stop_token, as_const(r))`, if this expression is well formed and satisfies `stoppable_token`, and is `noexcept`.

    2. Otherwise, `never_stop_token{}`.

3. Let `r` be a receiver, `s` be a sender, and `op_state` be an operation state resulting from an `execution::connect(s, r)` call. Let `token` be a stop token resulting from an `execution::get_stop_token(r)` call. `token` must remain valid at least until a call to
    a receiver completion-signal function of `r` returns successfully. [<i>Note</i>: this means that, unless it knows about further guarantees provided by the receiver `r`, the implementation of `op_state` should not use `token` after it makes a call to a receiver
    completion-signal function of `r`. This also implies that stop callbacks registered on `token` by the implementation of `op_state` or `s` must be destroyed before such a call to a receiver completion-signal function of `r`. --<i>end note</i>]

## Operation states <b>[execution.op_state]</b> ## {#spec-execution.op_state}

1. The `operation_state` concept defines the requirements for an operation state type, which allows for starting the execution of work.

    <pre highlight=c++>
    template&lt;class O>
      concept operation_state =
        destructible&lt;O> &&
        is_object_v&lt;O> &&
        requires (O& o) {
          { execution::start(o) } noexcept;
        };
    </pre>

### `execution::start` <b>[execution.op_state.start]</b> ### {#spec-execution.op_state.start}

1. `execution::start` is used to start work represented by an operation state object.

2. The name `execution::start` denotes a customization point object. The expression `execution::start(O)` for some lvalue subexpression `O` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::start, O)`, if that expression is valid. If the function selected by `tag_invoke` does not start the work represented by the operation state `O`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::start(O)` is ill-formed.

3. The caller of `execution::start(O)` must guarantee that the lifetime of the operation state object `O` extends at least until one of the receiver completion-signal functions of a receiver `R` passed into the `execution::connect` call that produced `O` is ready
    to successfully return. [<i>Note:</i> this allows for the receiver to manage the lifetime of the operation state object, if destroying it is the last operation it performs in its completion-signal functions. --<i>end note</i>]

## Senders <b>[execution.senders]</b> ## {#spec-execution.senders}

1. A sender describes a potentially asynchronous operation. A sender's responsibility is to fulfill the receiver contract of a connected receiver by delivering one of the receiver completion-signals.

2. The `sender` concept defines the requirements for a sender type. The `sender_to` concept defines the requirements for a sender type capable of being connected with a specific receiver type.

    <pre highlight=c++>
    template&lt;class S>
      concept sender =
        move_constructible&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S>> &&
        !requires {
          typename sender_traits&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S>>::__unspecialized; // exposition only
        };

    template&lt;class S, class R>
      concept sender_to =
        sender&lt;S> &&
        receiver&lt;R> &&
        requires (S&& s, R&& r) {
          execution::connect((S&&) s, (R&&) r);
        };
    </pre>

3. A sender is <i>typed</i> if it declares what types it sends through a connected receiver's channels.

4. The `typed_sender` concept defines the requirements for a typed sender type.

    <pre highlight=c++>
    template&lt;class S>
      concept <i>has-sender-types</i> = // exposition only
        requires {
          typename <i>has-value-types</i>&lt;S::template value_types>;
          typename <i>has-error-types</i>&lt;S::template error_types>;
          typename bool_constant&lt;S::sends_done>;
        };

    template&lt;class S>
      concept typed_sender =
        sender&lt;S> &&
        <i>has-sender-types</i>&lt;sender_traits&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;S>>>;
    </pre>

5. The `sender_of` concept defines the requirements for a typed sender type that on successful completion sends the specified set of value types.

    <pre highlight=c++>
    template&ltclass... Ts>
      struct <i>type-list</i> {};

    template&ltclass S, class... Ts>
      concept sender_of =
        typed_sender&ltS> &&
        same_as&lt
          <i>type-list</i>&ltTs...>,
          typename sender_traits&ltS>::value_types&lt<i>type-list</i>, type_identity_t>
        >;
    </pre>

### Sender traits <b>[execution.senders.traits]</b> ### {#spec-execution.senders.traits}

1. The class `sender_base` is used as a base class to tag sender types which do not expose member templates `value_types`, `error_types`, and a static member constant expression `sends_done`.

2. The class template `sender_traits` is used to query a sender type for facts associated with the signal it sends.

3. The primary class template `sender_traits<S>` is defined as if inheriting from an implementation-defined class template <code><i>sender-traits-base</i>&lt;S></code> defined as follows:

    1. If <code><i>has-sender-types</i>&lt;S></code> is `true`, then <code><i>sender-traits-base</i>&lt;S></code> is equivalent to:

        <pre highlight=c++>
        template&lt;class S>
          struct <i>sender-traits-base</i> {
            template&lt;template&lt;class...> class Tuple, template&lt;class...> class Variant>
              using value_types = typename S::template value_types&lt;Tuple, Variant>;

            template&lt;template&lt;class...> class Variant>
              using error_types = typename S::template error_types&lt;Variant>;

            static constexpr bool sends_done = S::sends_done;
          };
        </pre>

    2. Otherwise, if `derived_from<S, sender_base>` is `true`, then <code><i>sender-traits-base&lt;S></i></code> is equivalent to

        <pre highlight=c++>
        template&lt;class S>
          struct <i>sender-traits-base</i> {};
        </pre>

    3. Otherwise, <code><i>sender-traits-base</i>&lt;S></code> is equivalent to

        <pre highlight=c++>
        template&lt;class S>
          struct <i>sender-traits-base</i> {
            using __unspecialized = void; // exposition only
          };
        </pre>

4. If `sender_traits<S>::value_types<Tuple, Variant>` for some sender type `S` is well formed, it shall be a type `Variant<Tuple<Args0..., Args1..., ..., ArgsN...>>`, where the type packs `Args0` through `ArgsN` are the packs of types the sender `S` passes as
    arguments to `execution::set_value` after a receiver object. If such sender `S` invokes `execution::set_value(r, args...)` for some receiver `r`, where `decltype(args)` is not one of the type packs `Args0` through `ArgsN`, the program is ill-formed with no
    diagnostic required.

5. If `sender_traits<S>::error_types<Variant>` for some sender type `S` is well formed, it shall be a type `Variant<E0, E1, ..., EN>`, where the types `E0` through `EN` are the types the sender `S` passes as arguments to `execution::set_error` after a receiver
    object. If such sender `S` invokes `execution::set_error(r, e)` for some receiver `r`, where `decltype(e)` is not one of the types `E0` through `EN`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

6. If `sender_traits<S>::sends_done` is well formed and `true`, and such sender `S` invokes `execution::set_done(r)` for some receiver `r`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

7. Users may specialize `sender_traits` on program-defined types.

### `execution::connect` <b>[execution.senders.connect]</b> ### {#spec-execution.senders.connect}

1. `execution::connect` is used to <i>connect</i> a sender with a receiver, producing an operation state object that represents the work that needs to be performed to satisfy the receiver contract of the receiver with values that are the result of the operations
    described by the sender.

2. The name `execution::connect` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpressions `s` and `r`, let `S` be `decltype((s))` and `R` be `decltype((r))`. If `R` does not satisfy `execution::receiver` or `S` does not satisfy `execution::sender`,
    `execution::connect(s, r)` is ill-formed. Otherwise, the expression `execution::connect(s, r)` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::connect, s, r)`, if that expression is valid and its type satisfies `execution::operation_state`. If the function selected by `tag_invoke` does not return an operation state for which `execution::start` starts work described by `s`, the program
        is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::connect(s, r)` is ill-formed.

3. Standard sender types shall always expose an rvalue-qualified overload of a customization of `execution::connect`. Standard sender types shall only expose an lvalue-qualified overload of a customization of `execution::connect` if they are copyable.

### Sender queries <b>[execution.senders.queries]</b> ### {#spec-execution.senders.queries}

#### `execution::get_completion_scheduler` <b>[execution.senders.queries.get_completion_scheduler]</b> #### {#spec-execution.senders.queries.get_completion_scheduler}

1. `execution::get_completion_scheduler` is used to ask a sender object for the <i>completion scheduler</i> for one of its signals.

2. The name `execution::get_completion_scheduler` denotes a customization point object template. For some subexpression `s`, let `S` be `decltype((s))`. If `S` does not satisfy `execution::sender`, `execution::get_completion_scheduler` is ill-formed. If the template
    argument `CPO` in `execution::get_completion_scheduler<CPO>` is not one of `execution::set_value_t`, `execution::set_error_t`, or `execution::set_done_t`, `execution::get_completion_scheduler<CPO>` is ill-formed. Otherwise,
    `execution::get_completion_scheduler<CPO>(s)` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::get_completion_scheduler<CPO>, as_const(s))`, if this expression is well formed and satisfies `execution::scheduler`, and is `noexcept`.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::get_completion_scheduler<CPO>(s)` is ill-formed.

3. If, for some sender `s` and customization point object `CPO`, `execution::get_completion_scheduler<decltype(CPO)>(s)` is well-formed and results in a scheduler `sch`, and the sender `s` invokes `CPO(r, args...)`, for some receiver `r` which has been connected to
    `s`, with additional arguments `args...`, on an execution agent which does not belong to the associated execution context of `sch`, the behavior is undefined.

### Sender factories <b>[execution.senders.factories]</b> ### {#spec-execution.senders.factories}

#### General <b>[execution.senders.factories.general]</b> #### {#spec-execution.senders.factories.general}

1. Subclause [execution.senders.factories] defines <i>sender factories</i>, which are utilities that return senders without accepting senders as arguments.

#### `execution::schedule` <b>[execution.senders.schedule]</b> #### {#spec-execution.senders.schedule}

1. `execution::schedule` is used to obtain a sender associated with a scheduler, which can be used to describe work to be started on that scheduler's associated execution context.

2. The name `execution::schedule` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpression `s`, let `S` be `decltype((s))`. If `S` does not satisfy `execution::scheduler`, `execution::schedule` is ill-formed. Otherwise, the expression `execution::schedule(s)`
    is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::schedule, s)`, if that expression is valid and its type satisfies `execution::sender`. If the function selected by `tag_invoke` does not return a sender whose `set_value` completion scheduler is equivalent to `s`, the program is ill-formed with no
        diagnostic required.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::schedule(s)` is ill-formed.

#### `execution::just` <b>[execution.senders.just]</b> #### {#spec-execution.senders.just}

1. `execution::just` is used to create a sender that propagates a set of values to a connected receiver.

    <pre highlight=c++>

        friend void tag_invoke(execution::start_t, operation_state& s)
          noexcept {
          try {
            apply([&s](Ts &... values_) {
              execution::set_value(std::move(s.r_), std::move(values_)...);

          }
          catch (...) {
            execution::set_error(std::move(s.r_), current_exception());

    </pre>

1. <i>Effects</i>: Initializes `vs_` with `make_tuple(forward<Ts>(ts)...)`.

2. <i>Remarks</i>: The expression in the `noexcept-specifier` is equivalent to

    <pre highlight=c++>
    (is_nothrow_constructible_v&lt;remove_cvref_t&lt;Ts>, Ts> && ...)
    </pre>

#### `execution::transfer_just` <b>[execution.senders.transfer_just]</b> #### {#spec-execution.senders.transfer_just}

1. `execution::transfer_just` is used to create a sender that propagates a set of values to a connected receiver on an execution agent belonging to the associated execution context of a specified scheduler.

2. The name `execution::transfer_just` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpressions `s` and `vs...`, let `S` be `decltype((s))` and `Vs...` be `decltype((vs))`. If `S` does not satisfy `execution::scheduler`, or any type `V` in `Vs` does not
    satisfy <code><i>moveable-value</i></code>, `execution::transfer_just(s, vs...)` is ill-formed. Otherwise, `execution::transfer_just(s, vs...)` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::transfer_just, s, vs...)`, if that expression is valid and its type satisfies `execution::typed_sender`. If the function selected by `tag_invoke` does not return a sender whose `set_value` completion scheduler is equivalent to `s` and sends
        values equivalent to `vs...` to a receiver connected to it, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

    2. Otherwise, `execution::transfer(execution::just(vs...), s)`.

### Sender adaptors <b>[execution.senders.adaptors]</b> ### {#spec-execution.senders.adaptors}

#### General <b>[execution.senders.adaptors.general]</b> #### {#spec-execution.senders.adaptors.general}

1. Subclause [execution.senders.adaptors] defines <i>sender adaptors</i>, which are utilities that transform one or more senders into a sender with custom behaviors. When they accept a single sender argument, they can be chained to create sender chains.

2. The bitwise OR operator is overloaded for the purpose of creating sender chains. The adaptors also support function call syntax with equivalent semantics.

3. Most sender adaptors have two versions, an <i>potentially eager version</i>, and a <i>strictly lazy</i> version. For such sender adaptors, <code><i>adaptor</i></code> is the potentially eager version, and <code>lazy&lowbar;<i>adaptor</i></code> is the strictly
    lazy version.

4. A strictly lazy version of a sender adaptor is required to not begin executing any functions which would observe or modify any of the arguments of the adaptor before the returned sender is connected with a receiver using `execution::connect`, and
    `execution::start` is called on the resulting operation state. This requirement applies to any function that is selected by the implementation of the sender adaptor.

5. Unless otherwise specified, all sender adaptors which accept a single `sender` argument return sender objects that propagate sender queries to that single sender argument. This requirement applies to any function that is selected by the implementation of the
    sender adaptor.

6. Unless otherwise specified, whenever a strictly lazy sender adaptor constructs a receiver it passes to another sender's connect, that receiver shall propagate receiver queries to a receiver accepted as an argument of `execution::connect`. This requirements
    applies to any sender returned from a function that is selected by the implementation of a strictly lazy sender adaptor.

#### Sender adaptor closure objects <b>[execution.senders.adaptor.objects]</b> #### {#spec-execution.senders.adaptor.objects}

1. A <i>pipeable sender adaptor closure object</i> is a function object that accepts one or more `sender` arguments and returns a `sender`. For a sender adaptor closure object `C` and an expression `S` such that `decltype((S))` models `sender`, the following
    expressions are equivalent and yield a `sender`:

    <pre highlight=c++>
    C(S)
    S | C
    </pre>

    Given an additional pipeable sender adaptor closure object `D`, the expression `C | D` is well-formed and produces another range adaptor closure object such that the following two expressions are equivalent:

    <pre highlight=c++>
    S | C | D
    S | (C | D)
    </pre>

2. A <i>pipeable sender adaptor object</i> is a customization point object that accepts a `sender` as its first argument and returns a `sender`.

3. If a pipeable sender adaptor object accepts only one argument, then it is a pipeable sender adaptor closure object.

4. If a pipeable sender adaptor object accepts more than one argument, then the following expressions are equivalent:

    <pre highlight=c++>
    <i>adaptor</i>(sender, args...)
    <i>adaptor</i>(args...)(sender)
    sender | <i>adaptor</i>(args...)
    </pre>

    In that case, <code><i>adaptor</i>(args...)</code> is a pipeable sender adaptor closure object.

#### `execution::on` <b>[execution.senders.adaptors.on]</b> #### {#spec-execution.senders.adaptors.on}

1. `execution::on` and `execution::lazy_on` are used to adapt a sender in a sender that will start the input sender on an execution agent belonging to a specific execution context.

2. The name `execution::on` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpressions `sch` and `s`, let `Sch` be `decltype((sch))` and `S` be `decltype((s))`. If `Sch` does not satisfy `execution::scheduler`, or `S` does not satisfy `execution::sender`,
    `execution::on` is ill-formed. Otherwise, the expression `execution::on(sch, s)` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::on, sch, s)`, if that expression is valid and its type satisfies `execution::sender`.

    2. Otherwise, `lazy_on(sch, s)`.

    If the function selected above does not return a sender which starts `s` on an execution agent of the associated execution context of `sch`, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

3. The name `execution::lazy_on` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpressions `sch` and `s`, let `Sch` be `decltype((sch))` and `S` be `decltype((s))`. If `Sch` does not satisfy `execution::scheduler`, or `S` does not satisfy `execution::sender`,
    `execution::lazy_on` is ill-formed. Otherwise, the expression `execution::lazy_on(sch, s)` is expression-equivalent to:

    1. `tag_invoke(execution::lazy_on, sch, s)`, if that expression is valid and its type satisfies `execution::sender`. If the function selected above does not return a sender which starts `s` on an execution agent of the associated execution context of `sch` when
        started, the program is ill-formed with no diagnostic required.

    2. Otherwise, constructs a sender `s2`. When `s2` is connected with some receiver `out_r`, it results in an operation state `op_state`. When `execution::start` is called on `op_state`, it:

        1. Constructs a receiver `r`:

            2. When `execution::set_error(r2, e)` is called, it calls `execution::set_error(out_r, e)`.

            3. When `execution::done(r2)` is called, it calls `execution::set_done(out_r)`.

            It then calls `execution::schedule(sch)`, resulting in a sender `s3`. It then calls `execution::connect(s3, r2)`, resulting in an operation state `op_state3`. It then calls `execution::start(op_state3)`. If any of these throws an exception,
            it catches it and calls `execution::set_error(out_r, current_exception())`.

        3. Returns an operation state `op_state` that contains `op_state2`. When `execution::start(op_state)` is called, calls `execution::start(op_state2)`.

    3. Otherwise, constructs a sender `s2`. When `s2` is connected with some receiver `out_r`, it:

        1. Constructs a receiver `r`:

            1. When `execution::set_value(r, args...)` is called, calls `f(i, args...)` for each `i` of type `Shape` from `0` to `shape`, then calls `execution::set_value(out_r, args...)`. If any of these throws an exception, it catches it and calls
                `execution::set_error(out_r, current_exception())`.

            2. When `execution::set_error(r, e)` is called, calls `execution::set_error(out_r, e)`.

            3. When `execution::set_done(r, e)` is called, calls `execution::set_done(out_r, e)`.

        2. Calls `execution::connect(s, r)`, which results in an operation state `op_state2`.

        3. Returns an operation state `op_state` that contains `op_state2`. When `execution::start(op_state)` is called, calls `execution::start(op_state2)`.

    If the function selected above does not return a sender which invokes `f(i, args...)` for each `i` of type `Shape` from `0` to `shape` when the input sender sends values `args...`, or does not propagate the values of the signals sent by the input sender to

1. `execution::split` and `execution::lazy_split` are used to adapt an arbitrary sender into a sender that can be connected multiple times.

2. The name `execution::split` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpression `s`, let `S` be `decltype((s))`. If `S` does not satisfy `execution::typed_sender`, `execution::split` is ill-formed. Otherwise, the expression `execution::split(s)` is
    expression-equivalent to:

    3. Otherwise, constructs a sender `s2`, which:

        1. Creates an object `sh_state`. The lifetime of `sh_state` shall last for at least as long as the lifetime of the last operation state object returned from `execution::connect(s, some_r)` for some receiver `some_r`.

        2. Constructs a receiver `r`:

            1. When `execution::set_value(r, args...)` is called, saves the expressions `args...` as subobjects of `sh_state`.

            2. When `execution::set_error(r, e)` is called, saves the expression `e` as a subobject of `sh_state`.

            3. When `execution::set_done(r)` is called, saves this fact in `sh_state`.

        3. Calls `execution::connect(s, r)`, resulting in an operation state `op_state2`. `op_state2` is saved as a subobject of `sh_state`.

        4. When `s2` is connected with a receiver `out_r`, it returns an operation state object `op_state`. When `execution::start(op_state)` is called, it calls `execution::start(op_state2)`, if this is the first time this expression would be evaluated. When both
            `execution::start(op_state)` and <code><i>Signal</i>(r, args...)</code> have been called, calls <code><i>Signal</i>(out_r, args2...)</code>, where `args2...` is a pack of lvalues referencing the subobjects of `sh_state` that have been saved by the
            original call to <code><i>Signal</i>(r, args...)</code>.

        3. Constructs a sender `s2`. When `s2` is connected with some receiver `out_r`, it results in an operation state `op_state2`. Once both `execution::start(op_state2)` and one of the receiver completion-signals has been called on `r`:

            1. If `execution::set_value(r, ts...)` has been called, calls `execution::set_value(out_r, ts...)`.

## `execution::execute` <b>[execution.execute]</b> ## {#spec-execution.execute}

1. `execution::execute` is used to create fire-and-forget tasks on a specified scheduler.

2. The name `execution::execute` denotes a customization point object. For some subexpressions `sch` and `f`, let `Sch` be `decltype((sch))` and `F` be `decltype((f))`. If `Sch` does not satisfy `execution::scheduler` or `F` does not satisfy `invocable<>`,
